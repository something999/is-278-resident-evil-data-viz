Unknown Speaker,,Non-Playable,"Her name is Claire Redfield. We caught her trespassing in our Paris Lab facility 10 days ago. She apparently infiltrated the complex looking for her lost brother, Chris Redfield, one of the surviving members of R.P.D.'s famous S.T.A.R.S. teams."
Rodrigo,Male,Non-Playable,Don't Move.
Rodrigo,Male,Non-Playable,"Perfect! Go on, get out of here, this place is finished. I don't know, it might have been a special forces team. But in any case this prison has been taken over, the troops have been wiped out."
Claire,Female,Playable,What are you saying?
Rodrigo,Male,Non-Playable,"Your free to leave the complex, but you may as well know, you have  no chance of getting off this island."
Claire,Female,Playable,"And what about you, what are you going to do?"

Claire,Female,Playable,You mean my brother?
Steve,,Playable,Ahh...your siblings. Well it seems your brother is under surveillance by Umbrella.
Claire,Female,Playable,What?! I got to connect Leon and tell him to let my brother know he's being monitored. Its a good thing I have access to an outside connection from here.
Steve,,Playable,Well that file shows the latitude and longitude of this place. Ha! Why don't you send your brother the coordinates and ask him to come help.
Claire,Female,Playable,Thanks! I'll do that!
Steve,,Playable,"Hey! I was just kidding! There’s no way he could get here, even if he is your brother."
Claire,Female,Playable,"Yes he can, I'm sure of it."
Steve,,Playable,No way! He won't come! You'll end up disappointed if you rely on others! Believe me! I know!
Claire,Female,Playable,What was that all about?

Claire,Female,Playable,What are you talking about?!

Claire,Female,Playable,I have no idea what your babbling about.
Alfred,Male,Non-Playable,"You don't fool me! I am Alfred Ashford, commander of this base."
Claire,Female,Playable,Oh?! You must be one of Umbrella's lower level officers if your commander of a back water base like this one!
Alfred,Male,Non-Playable,"How dare you! The Ashford family is among the worlds first and finest, my grandfather is one of the original founders of Umbrella Inc. Now tell me, why have you attacked this installations?"
Claire,Female,Playable,Attacked?!
Alfred,Male,Non-Playable,"Shortly after you arrived, my base was attacked, you must have informed your people its location."
Claire,Female,Playable,"I still don't follow you, I really don't know anything about that."
Alfred,Male,Non-Playable,"Unacceptable! How can you deny it, my base has been destroyed, and thanks to you the experimental T-Virus was released, creating countless zombies and monsters....Tell me, who do you work for? Who sent you!"

Alfred,Male,Non-Playable,"My apologizes Alexia, but I have been doing my best."
Alexia,Female,Non-Playable,The revival of the Ashford family depends on your success brother.
Alfred,Male,Non-Playable,I am aware of that Alexia. I will revive the family name myself and make you the master of the glorious Ashford family.
Alexia,Female,Non-Playable,"Do not worry brother, I will handle both of them myself. Who is there? Is someone in the corridor?"
Alfred,Male,Non-Playable,What is it Alexia?
Alexia,Female,Non-Playable,"N...nothing, I believe I must have been imagining things. Let us go brother."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Greetings! You must be the lovely Claire Redfield.
Claire,Female,Playable,Who are you?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Lets just say that I’m a ghost, coming back to haunt your...dear brother."
Claire,Female,Playable,Wesker?!
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,It seems there’s not much explaining to do is there? I was the one who attacked this island. Who'd of though you'd be hanging about?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"All the better for me, now that the cat dragged in this nice surprised, your ever so caring brother. He'll definitely show up. I must thank you for being such good bait."
Claire,Female,Playable,"I don't know what went on between you two, but you have him all wrong, my brother's not the kind of person you think he is."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,I despise Chris!
Claire,Female,Playable,What are you going to do to him?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Oh how your brother will be surprised to see you die
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"What? What is it? Stay there, I’m coming."

Claire,Female,Playable,We better get out of here too.
Steve,,Playable,Right. Lets go!

Steve,,Playable,You got it!
Alfred,Male,Non-Playable,"This game is not over yet, now you will see what real terror is all about."
Steve,,Playable,"Hey, what the? The cargo room hatch is open."
Claire,Female,Playable,I'll go back and check it out.
Steve,,Playable,"Thanks, I’ve unlocked the cargo room door."
Steve,,Playable,What was wrong?
Claire,Female,Playable,"Oh nothing, just a giant cockroach that had to be stepped on."
Claire,Female,Playable,What’s happening?
Steve,,Playable,"I don't know, the plane just changed direction on its own."
Steve,,Playable,Its flying in auto-pilot mode I can't switch over to manual control.
Alfred,Male,Non-Playable,My apologizes but I cannot let you escape now.
Claire,Female,Playable,Alfred! Cross dressing freak!
Steve,,Playable,"Hey, where are we?"

Claire,Female,Playable,Thanks.
Steve,,Playable,"Oh uh, the planes trashed, lets split up and find another way off this oversized freezer."
Claire,Female,Playable,Right.
Steve,,Playable,"Okay, lets do it."
Steve,,Playable,"Claire, it looks like there’s an Australian observation base about seven miles away from here, that should be our target."
Claire,Female,Playable,"Then if we could break through the wall with that digging vehicle, we might have a chance."
Steve,,Playable,"Okay, lets do it!"
Claire,Female,Playable,Steve watch out!
Steve,,Playable,No! Its toxic gas.
Claire,Female,Playable,Come on!
Steve,,Playable,Its all my fault.
Claire,Female,Playable,"Don't say that, listen to me, we'll escape from here...together. Come on we've have to shut off the gas, if we split up we'll have a better chance of stopping it."
Steve,,Playable,Okay
Claire,Female,Playable,Steve! Don't forget we'll get out of here...together.
Steve,,Playable,"Claire, it looks like there’s an Australian observation base about seven miles away from here, that should be our target."

Chris,Male,Playable,I came here looking for a certain girl.
Rodrigo,Male,Non-Playable,A girl?
Chris,Male,Playable,Have you seen anyone named Claire Redfield?
Rodrigo,Male,Non-Playable,Did you just say Claire?
Chris,Male,Playable,"You know who she is, don't you?!"
Rodrigo,Male,Non-Playable,"Don't worry about her, I helped her escape, several planes took off  from this island not long ago, well I can't say for certain, she was  probably on one of them."
Chris,Male,Playable,"I see, I guess my sister owes you, thanks for helping."
Rodrigo,Male,Non-Playable,"Everyone's gone, you'll be the only other person left, go on, follow  your sister and get off this island."
Chris,Male,Playable,Hold on! Don't give up!

Claire,Female,Playable,I'm sure of it
Chris,Male,Playable,It's Alexia!
Claire,Female,Playable,Alexia? There really is an Alexia?
