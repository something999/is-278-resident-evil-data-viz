Jake,Male,"This stuff do anything for you yet? Supposed to be some kind of energy booster, but I don’t feel any different. You know, between me and you, I think we should’ve asked for more money. A lot more."
Jake,Male,Pretty sure this wasn’t part of the contract… But I am willing to renegotiate.
Sherry,Female,Did you take your dose?
Jake,Male,"Yeah. But if you want your own hit, you gotta sign up with the lady downstairs. Wouldn’t recommend it, though."
Sherry,Female,No question. You’ve got the antibodies.
Jake,Male,"Thank you very much. Wait, what?"
Sherry,Female,"You could be the key to saving this world, Jake Muller."
Jake,Male,Better save myself first.
Jake,Male,You lose something?
Sherry,Female,Just my balance. I’m fine.
Sherry,Female,"Sherry Birkin, the United States—"
Jake,Male,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good for you, but now’s not really the time. You coming?"
Sherry,Female,"After you. Those things up there were J’avo, they’re the B.O.W.s the insurgents are using."
Jake,Male,That explains why there’s a shitload of BSAA troops here.
Sherry,Female,We need to get out of the country without drawing either party’s attention.
Jake,Male,Goddamn BSAA! What the hell are you shooting at?
Sherry,Female,"Everyone in your platoon is one of those J’avo now! And you’re dressed just like them. Come on, we have to get out of here!"
Jake,Male,"Man, look at this circus. Got any popcorn?"
Sherry,Female,Stop gawking! We don’t have time!
Jake,Male,"All right, first things first. I want 200,000 up front, another 200 when this is over. Oh, and B.O.W.s? Those are extra. An additional grand. Each."
Sherry,Female,I’m not here to hire you.
Jake,Male,What? Why are you here?
Sherry,Female,Your blood.
Jake,Male,"What are you, the Red Cross or something?"
Sherry,Female,"No, listen those… things that attacked us, they were all exposed to a new virus called the C-Virus. The same strain that you just took a dose of. It didn’t affect you because you’ve got the antibodies. Right now we’re racing against a global bioterrorist attack, and we needed a vaccine yesterday. We need you, Jake. We need your blood."
Jake,Male,50 million dollars.
Sherry,Female,What?
Jake,Male,Cash. Non-negotiable. That’ll get you one pint.
Jake,Male,Looks like they’re expecting us. We’re gonna have to shoot our way out.
Sherry,Female,Agreed. We don’t have a choice now.
Jake,Male,What are you waiting for?
Sherry,Female,Do I look like a circus acrobat to you? I’ll find another way. Just don’t wander off too far.
Jake,Male,Don’t worry. I ain’t running till I get my money. Whole place is falling apart. Easy does it.
Sherry,Female,Give me a hand!
Jake,Male,This is starting to feel like work.
Sherry,Female,Looks like the BSAA have got their work cut out for them.
Jake,Male,You don’t know the half of it. Last I checked my employers had a tank parked on the other side of the river. The only way the BSAA are leaving that bridge again are in bodybags.
Sherry,Female,No. You’re wrong. They’re more resilient than you can imagine.
Jake,Male,"Ah what the hell, I’m not one of those ‘roided out freaks, you morons."
Jake,Male,What do ya think? Fight or flight?
Sherry,Female,There’s too many of ’em! I’m gonna go with flight!
Jake,Male,"All right, where to?"
Sherry,Female,Let’s go! This is a waste of time!
Jake,Male,"Yeah, no shit!"
Sherry,Female,Run!
Jake,Male,Eat this!
Sherry,Female,Thanks for the warning!
Jake,Male,"ОК… We go with your plan. Son of a bitch, he’s strong!"
Sherry,Female,Run!
Jake,Male,Here goes nothing!
Sherry,Female,Jake!
Jake,Male,It’s always something with women!
Jake,Male,What the hell is that thing?
Sherry,Female,"He’s tracking us. Well… technically, you."
Sherry,Female,"Look, we can get out there!"
Jake,Male,This place looks like it’s gonna collapse too. Somebody outta call the building inspector.
Sherry,Female,"Yeah. Boy it’s even colder in here than it was outside. Dammit, they found us!"
Jake,Male,"Shit, don’t these assholes have anything better to do!"
Sherry,Female,I don’t think he’s too keen on us leaving!
Jake,Male,"He’ll just have to get over it then, huh!"
Sherry,Female,You’re not taking Jake!
Jake,Male,Hope you haven’t forgotten about my 50 million dollars.
Sherry,Female,I’ll talk to my boss - if we make it out of here alive.
Jake,Male,"(to Ustanak) What’s wrong, asshole? Losing your nerve? Gotcha, you son of a bitch!"
Sherry,Female,"I swear, this mission gets harder by the minute. But at least you’re still safe. We’ve got a lot riding on us."
Jake,Male,"(chuckles) Three years ago I thought I was gonna die in the jungles of South America. Enemy had us surrounded. ’Fore I knew it, everyone on my team was dead. And I’d lost my gun in the scramble. This bastard comes at me with a knife. Probably thought I wasn’t even worth the bullet."
Sherry,Female,Why are you telling me this?
Jake,Male,Dying on a blade is the last way you wanna go. It’s a bitch. Mercs like me? We don’t get a say in how we die. That’s just how it goes.
Sherry,Female,"It’s… kind of what you signed up for, isn’t it?"
Jake,Male,"Dying for money’s one thing - that’s my choice. But dying for no good reason? That doesn’t sit right with me. ...So. You wanna tell me what that big friggin’ behemoth was, and why he’s trying to kill me?"
Sherry,Female,That thing is just like the J’avo - a bio-organic weapon created with the C-Virus. He’s being used by a terrorist organization called Neo-Umbrella.
Jake,Male,Never heard of ’em.
Sherry,Female,"They want to study the antibodies in your blood, and they don’t care if you’re dead or alive."
Jake,Male,I was better off as a mercenary.
Sherry,Female,I’m not gonna let anything happen to you. The world needs you.
Jake,Male,"No no, not me. Just my blood. Well, the world can have it. Long as someone ponies up the dough."
Sherry,Female,Sherry Birkin – National Security!
Chris,Male,Sherry Birkin? You were in Raccoon City.
Sherry,Female,How do you know that?
Chris,Male,Claire.
Sherry,Female,Wait... Are you Chris?
Chris,Male,My sister’s told me all about you.
Piers,Male,"Chris, that man is a wanted insurgent."
Sherry,Female,"Yes, he’s a mercenary. But right now he’s under the protection of the U.S. government. He’s no threat to the BSAA."
Jake,Male,Unless someone pays me to be.
Piers,Male,What did you just say?
Jake,Male,What?
Chris,Male,Nothing.
Radio,,HQ to Alpha Team. Reinforcements are unable to land due to anti-aircraft artillery. Take ’em out!
Chris,Male,"Alpha Team, copy."
Radio,,What the!? We’re picking up a large bogey on radar. It’s heading right for you!
Chris,Male,"We’ll talk later. Right now, you need to find cover."
Radio,,"Alpha Team, come in. This is Echo. Those three anti-aircraft turrets are holding us at bay."
Chris,Male,"Roger that, Echo, We’ll take care of them for you."
Soldier,,Our first target’s over here!
Sherry,Female,Chris! We’ll give you a hand!
Chris,Male,Out of the question! You need to get to safety!
Sherry,Female,"Don’t worry about me. I can handle myself, and you need the help!"
Jake,Male,Christ... My chances of survival were higher when I was a soldier of fortune.
Soldier,,"I’m setting charges on the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! I need you to distract that giant B.O.W.! I can’t work with that B.O.W. around!"
Sherry,Female,Chris! We’ll take care of one of those big ones!
Jake,Male,"Thanks for volunteering me for the job, babe."
Sherry,Female,I’m setting the charges now! Just need a little more time! The charges are set! Everyone get back!
Radio,,Only two guns left!
Soldier,,"OK, head to the next target! I’m setting charges on the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! Just need a little more time! The charges are set! Everyone get back!"
Radio,,"Good job, Aloha! One gun left! There’s another giant B.O.W. closing in on your location!"
Piers,Male,It’s the one we lost at the Two of Hearts!
Chris,Male,Alpha! Prepare to engage!
Soldier,,"Only one to go! Everyone into that underground passage! I’m setting charges on the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! Just need a little more time! I need you to distract that giant B.O.W.! I can’t work with that B.O.W. around! I’m setting the charges now! The charges are set! Everyone get back!"
Radio,,"All anti-aircraft guns have been silenced, Nice work, Alpha. But you’re not out of the woods yet. Echo Team can’t land until you take care of that other B.O.W. We’ll try to hit it from the air. See if it has any weaknesses."
Chris,Male,Targeting those exposed organs! Fire at will!
Radio,,"Good work out there, Alpha! Echo Team will be landing shortly."
Chris,Male,I already gave the pilot the coordinates.
Sherry,Female,Thank you so much for your help.
Chris,Male,(to Jake) Hey... Hey! Have we met?
Jake,Male,"You jarheads all look the same to me pal, sorry."
Piers,Male,You’ve gotta be kidding me!
Chris,Male,My mistake. Have a safe flight.
Sherry,Female,"Yes… but there’s something I need to run by you. Mr. Muller is requesting compensation for his cooperation... 50 million dollars. Yes. Yes, I understand. I’ll let him know."
Jake,Male,"So, we got a deal?"
Sherry,Female,"Yes, we have a deal."
Jake,Male,"That was easy. By the way, that guy that you were all chummy with back there..."
Sherry,Female,You mean Chris?
Jake,Male,That’s the one.
Sherry,Female,What about him?
Jake,Male,Forget it.
Sherry,Female,What was that?
Jake,Male,My gut’s goin’ with something bad. And here it comes.
Sherry,Female,Oh my God.
Jake,Male,That thing doesn’t give up.
Sherry,Female,We have to shoot him off or he’ll bring us down!
Jake,Male,"I’m getting 50 million. I don’t mind working for it a little. This thing is after you two, ain’t he!"
Sherry,Female,I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to put you in danger!
Jake,Male,"Don’t sweat it, kid! This is why I get paid the big bucks!"
Pilot,,Jump to the next chopper! Move! Now! What are you waiting for?
Cherry,,Jake!
Jake,Male,This just gets better and better. He’s locked on to us! This is getting a little crazy. Even for me!
Sherry,Female,e can’t take any more hits! We ve gotta shoot the missiles down!
Jake,Male,"I should’ve read the line print before signing up for this. Get your own helicopter, asshole!"
Sherry,Female,"Look, parachutes!"
Jake,Male,What do I do?
Sherry,Female,Pull it out...
Jake,Male,No! You’ll bleed to death.
Sherry,Female,Please...
Jake,Male,Don’t say I didn’t warn you.
Jake,Male,What the hell! You wanna tell me what the hell just happened?
Sherry,Female,Long story.
Jake,Male,Yeah? Maybe it’s your blood they should be testing for vaccines.
Sherry,Female,They already did. More than I could stand.
Jake,Male,What are you doing?
Sherry,Female,The data’s gone!
Jake,Male,What data?
Sherry,Female,"Your data! Your blood analysis, your genome, everything that we need to make a vaccine."
Jake,Male,"No! You mean everything I need to get my 50 million. Well, come on super girl, let’s get lookin’."
Sherry,Female,I had all your intel saved on a handful of data chips. We’ve gotta find them!
Jake,Male,"In the middle of a snowstorm? You really want me to work for that money, don’t you? Hey, look. There’s a shack up there. Finally, a little luck..."
Sherry,Female,"OK, first we find the data, then we’ll take shelter there."
Sherry,Female,"So this data you need to find. It’s about me, isn’t it?"
Sherry,Female,There are three data chips. I lost them in the crash. The locator will pinpoint each one’s position.
Jake,Male,"OK... We find your gear, and then I brew us up a nice, hot pot ’a coffee. Jesus... What are these nasty-looking things?"
Sherry,Female,"They’re J’avo, and they’re encased in a… cocoon. When they hatch… well… it isn’t pretty."
Jake,Male,"I’m so glad I was immune to that shit, they gave us. I’d rather be in there, kicking my feet, up, then out here on this stupid scavenger hunt. I must’ve pissed somebody off upstairs."
Sherry,Female,I sure could use a break about now... But finding that data is priority one.
Jake,Male,"So this little thing is chock full ’a data on me, huh. Two left. We’d better hurry before I freeze my ass off. Found another one. Doesn’t look, broken... OK. One more to go. And I bet you’ll be a real pain in the ass to find... Gotcha. Is that it for the data chips?"
Sherry,Female,"Yeah, thanks for the help. Now let’s get out of this cold."
Sherry,Female,I’ll go get help. It can’t be that much further to the rendezvous.
Jake,Male,Wait!
Jake,Male,So... You always been like that? The whole healing thing.
Sherry,Female,"My dad was a scientist. He was working on B.O.W.s when I was exposed. Luckily, I was treated with the vaccine before it was too late, but the virus adjusted and adapted. It’s been a part of me ever since."
Jake,Male,What happened to your father?
Sherry,Female,His research killed him. By the time he died his body had mutated so much… he wasn’t even recognizable.
Jake,Male,Sorry. I didn’t mean to...
Sherry,Female,"That’s all right. Besides, I didn’t walk out of it empty handed."
Jake,Male,"Yeah, you got super powers."
Sherry,Female,"That’s not what I meant. The people who saved me, Leon and Claire, are the closest friends I’ve ever had."
Jake,Male,"Claire is that BSAA guy’s sister, right?"
Sherry,Female,They risked their lives for me back in Raccoon City. I guess I’m still just trying to live up to their example—never giving up no matter the odds.
Jake,Male,Speaking of odds... Looks like we got some party crashers. But this cabin’s invitation only.
Sherry,Female,We’re surrounded! It’s an avalanche! Let’s get out of here!
Jake,Male,I told them to keep the noise down!
Jake,Male,"Punch it, before, we get buried alive! The whole mountain’s coming down! God must really hate us today!"
Sherry,Female,"We’ll make it, just keep going! Anyway... I don’t hate you!"
Jake,Male,Oh great. That helps!
Sherry,Female,"Oh, no! Go right!"
Jake,Male,Keep your speed up! I don’t want to be buried out here! This is not a good idea!
Sherry,Female,Too late now!
Jake,Male,Jump!
Sherry,Female,Are you OK?
Jake,Male,Don’t worry about me. I’m built like a tank.
Sherry,Female,Fine. I won’t. Let’s go.
Jake,Male,"Wow, nice acoustics... Watch your step."
Sherry,Female,I wonder how deep this mine goes.
Jake,Male,Jesus Christ! What does it take to kill that thing!
Sherry,Female,I think he’s using those bugs to sniff us out. Be careful.
Jake,Male,Shit! He found us!
Sherry,Female,"Quick, hide! Watch out for those bugs. If they find us..."
Jake,Male,"Yeah, yeah, I know. Tall, dark, and ugly’ll come tear us apart."
Sherry,Female,He’s found us!
Jake,Male,Hide before he comes! When’s it our turn to chase him?
Sherry,Female,He’ll kill us if he finds us.
Jake,Male,Thanks for the news flash. Shit! He found us!
Sherry,Female,"Quick, hide!"
Jake,Male,I’m not really a fan of hide and seek.
Sherry,Female,"Oh, you’d rather that thing kill you?"
Jake,Male,Shit! He found us!
Sherry,Female,"Quick, hide! Keep your hands to yourself!"
Jake,Male,"Hey, you’re the one rubbing up on me. Besides, what makes you think you’re my type?"
Sherry,Female,I would shoot you if I didn’t need you alive.
Jake,Male,"Seriously!? Geez, this guy doesn’t miss a beat!"
Sherry,Female,He sure can move fast for something that size.
Jake,Male,Shit! He found us!
Sherry,Female,"Quick, hide!"
Jake,Male,"Get the hell outta here, for Chrissakes! Shit! He found us!"
Sherry,Female,"Quick, hide!"
Jake,Male,I hate this hiding bullshit.
Sherry,Female,That was close.
Jake,Male,Aw shit... Run!
Sherry,Female,We can’t go anywhere without that key.
Jake,Male,Then let’s go get it.
Jake,Male,"Ha-ha! Whadya think of that, sucker!"
Sherry,Female,Quiet! He ’ll hear you!
Jake,Male,"Christ, he’s like a sales rep that won’t take no for an answer!"
Sherry,Female,I think this will stop him!
Jake,Male,"Oh, this is gonna be fun! Not so tough now, are ya!?"
Sherry,Female,We got him now! We did it. We beat him.
Jake,Male,Just barely. Is that the exit?
Sherry,Female,"Yeah, once we get out there, I’ll radio for pickup. My team should be close by. That’s the rendezvous."
Jake,Male,About damn time.
Jake,Male,Come on super girl.
Jake,Male,"You know, those shots of yours pack one hell of a punch, lady."
Ada,Female,"So, you’re Wesker Junior."
Jake,Male,Wesker? You lost me.
Ada,Female,"Albert Wesker was a colossal imbecile, a fool who tried to destroy the world. He was also your father."
Jake,Male,What!?
Ada,Female,Which makes you heir to a very special blood type.
Mercenary,,(in Chinese) “Keep moving.”
Jake,Male,"(in Chinese) “Sorry guys, time to move on.”"
Jake,Male,"I don’t need a weapon to kill assholes like you! Goodbye, shitty prison cell. It’s been a real slice of heaven."
Loudspeaker,,Two test subjects have escaped from their quarters. They must not leave the facility. Permission to use firearms has been granted. Repeat Two test Subjects have escaped from their quarters. They must not leave the facility. Permission to use firearms has been granted.
Jake,Male,"I knew she was here! I’m coming for you, Sherry."
Sherry,Female,Jake! Where are we?
Jake,Male,China.
Sherry,Female,"Obviously, but where? Why?"
Jake,Male,"Don’t know, don’t care."
Jake,Male,I just know I am done being their guinea pig.
Sherry,Female,What did they do to you?
Jake,Male,Plenty. They said something about using my antibody to enhance the C-Virus.
Sherry,Female,What else did they say?
Jake,Male,You know anything about an Albert Wesker?
Sherry,Female,What?
Jake,Male,"I’ll take that as a yes. They talked about him. A lot. I guess he had an antibody that could fight off any virus. Apparently, he abused his gift, took it for granted, and then ended up turning himself into a some kind of monster. And here I thought dear old dad was just a deadbeat who skipped out on us no, no, no... he was actually... a freakin’ nut job who almost destroyed the world!"
Sherry,Female,Your father’s actions have nothing to do with you.
Jake,Male,"Yeah, but his blood does. It’s the whole reason why we’re even here. I mean, come on! You really think that crazy doesn’t run in the family? That nothing of who my father was didn’t somehow get passed on down to me? You of all people should know that’s true. I’m just sayin’... The man that I am, the things that I’ve done at least it all makes a little bit more sense now. What?"
Sherry,Female,You can blame your father all you want. But at some point you have to take responsibility for your own actions. I have to let my superiors know I’m OK. But first we need a way to contact them.
Jake,Male,Hm? What the hell’s this?
Jake,Male,"I’ll tell you this, it took a lot of money to build something this big."
Sherry,Female,No kidding. I never saw anything outside of the one crappy room they had me in.
Jake,Male,"Hey, look. We can get out here."
Sherry,Female,"Yeah. But until I talk to my superiors, I don’t even know where to go."
Jake,Male,Why does everything have to be a such pain in the ass? All right. Guess we better find a way for you to phone home.
Jake,Male,"Three medallions for the west. And it says it takes ten medallions to gain passage to the east. OK, we know what they look like. Now we find the rest. So, what’d they have you doing for the past six months?"
Sherry,Female,You name it. They were trying to research the virus I’m carrying. It was the same thing I went through after Raccoon City. And it was just as shitty the second time.
Jake,Male,Jeez. I’m sorry.
Jake,Male,What is this?
Sherry,Female,Data from your experiments. Here we go.
Jake,Male,Hello!
Sherry,Female,It’s all right here.
Jake,Male,Why don’t you call your boss?
Sherry,Female,"It’s me, Sherry Birkin... Yes, he’s OK. We were detained… at a facility in China. Really!? All right, I’ll send you our exact coordinates. (to Jake) They’re already here in China! It’s over, we’re saved."
Jake,Male,"Hallelujah. So, you ready?"
Sherry,Female,Done. Now let’s get the hell outta here.
Jake,Male,Let’s go! These guys aren’t much for conversation.
Sherry,Female,Good. I was sick of this place anyway.
Jake,Male,Are you kidding me!?
Sherry,Female,Oh crap! Run!
Jake,Male,"Jesus Christ! Oh, come on! Enough already! How the hell do I get over there? I could swing off that statue if I got it to the right angle. Haha! That works! Let’s try it again. I hope you break your stupid statue! Thanks for the opening! Sherry! I found a bike! Just hold on!"
Sherry,Female,OK!
Sherry,Female,Yes… we’re all right. Understood. I’ll make sure.. We’ll be there soon.
Jake,Male,What did he say?
Sherry,Female,He gave me the rendezvous coordinates. It’s close.
Jake,Male,Great. Hang on!
Sherry,Female,They’re trying to mow us down!
Jake,Male,"Yeah, thanks, I have ears! God only knows how we’re gonna get out of this! Hold on to me!"
Sherry,Female,Oh my God... Jake!
Jake,Male,This city is going to hell in a handbasket.
Jake,Male,"Hey! Shoot that thing, would ya!"
Sherry,Female,This is really starting to hurt.
Jake,Male,"Next time I’ll steal a limo! Hold on as tight as you can, OK?"
Sherry,Female,Jake!
Jake,Male,Son of a… Goddamn it!
Sherry,Female,I can’t hold on!
Jake,Male,Yes you can! I’m coming!
Jake,Male,You OK?
Sherry,Female,Yeah. Nice catch. The helicopter’s back!
Jake,Male,Bastard was waiting for us. Hang on!
Sherry,Female,They’re still on us!
Jake,Male,As if we didn’t have enough problems! Watch out! Here we go! Hold on!
Jake,Male,You all right?
Sherry,Female,I’m fine.
Jake,Male,"Come on. Shit. Looks like Redfield and his boyscouts are here, too."
Sherry,Female,Jake! Chris’ team will protect us.
Jake,Male,We don’t need their help. I didn’t ask for it either.
Sherry,Female,"I know you don’t like him, but if Chris is here..."
Jake,Male,"All right, all right! Enough about Redfield! Geez, it’s getting old! These guys don’t know who they’re dealing with. Time to clue ’em in. Droppin’ like flies. We’ll have this mess mopped up in no time."
Sherry,Female,Jake! He’s the last one!
Jake,Male,"Hmph, and I thought we’d be here all night. This way!"
Sherry,Female,OK.
Jake,Male,"Screw all this running. I’m taking that, chopper out."
Sherry,Female,How? With what?
Jake,Male,Not sure. Kinda making this up as I go!
Sherry,Female,Chris is on the roof trying to take that chopper down.
Jake,Male,"Not goin’ too well for him, is it? Wanna show him how it’s done?"
Sherry,Female,"Well, I have some explosive rounds that could even the odds."
Sherry,Female,Jake! No! You’ll be killed!
Jake,Male,You know what they say about desperate times! Watch and learn!
Jake,Male,You’re going down!
Sherry,Female,"Come on, let’s go. Our orders are to avoid contact with anyone."
Jake,Male,Does he know that Wesker was my father?
Sherry,Female,I don’t think so. Why?
Jake,Male,No reason. Maybe I just rubbed him the wrong way.
Jake,Male,"Did you even see the kind of helicopter they sent after us? A bird like that costs around fifteen million dollars. Man, terrorism is lucrative."
Sherry,Female,Maybe they have an oil baron or two in their pocket.
Jake,Male,"Oil Barons? In the country I was born in, people think Uncle Sam causes most of the problems in this world."
Sherry,Female,"Yeah, sure, everyone loves to blame America for everything. We’re not the bad guy, Jake. Look, these terrorists have unleashed bioweapons on our country, too!"
Jake,Male,So the whole world’s going to hell.
Sherry,Female,And you’re the only one who can save it.
Jake,Male,"Well, shit. As long as there’s no pressure, right? Man, everywhere you look, there’s more of these assholes. Sucks being so popular."
Sherry,Female,"There’s no sneaking around them, is there?"
Jake,Male,"It’s bolted shut? Ah, fuck me… Come on, we gotta figure out a way to get this thing open. Sherry, it’s open! Smells like death. Just like Edonia."
Sherry,Female,Jake! Are you OK?
Jake,Male,"I’ve taken bigger spills. Course, I don’t have that healing factor of yours."
Sherry,Female,Too bad the fall didn’t knock the wise ass out of you. This one’s bolted shut too.
Jake,Male,"Another one? All right, here we go again,"
Sherry,Female,It’s open — c’mon!
Sherry,Female,Don’t get too close! You’ll be ripped to shreds!
Jake,Male,"Yeah, thanks. I know what a chainsaw can do!"
Jake,Male,"Now’s our chance! He’s all yours! Take that, you piece of shit! Did that do it?"
Sherry,Female,I think he’s down.
Sherry,Female,It’s American...!
Sherry,Female,Is that… Leon?
Leon,Male,Sherry? What are you doing here?
Sherry,Female,I’m on protective detail.
Leon,Male,"Yeah, I heard you became an agent."
Sherry,Female,Why are you here?
Leon,Male,I’m tracking the man behind all this. Chief Security Advisor Simmons.
Sherry,Female,What!? There must be some sort of mistake. I report to Simmons!
Leon,Male,He’s your supervisor?
Sherry,Female,We’re on our way to meet with him right now.
Leon,Male,Where is he! I need to know—
Jake,Male,Hey!
Sherry,Female,Jake! Let me handle this.
Jake,Male,I thought your orders were to avoid contact… with anyone.
Sherry,Female,Leon’s not just anyone. He saved my life back in Raccoon City.
Jake,Male,Fair enough.
Helena,Female,Look out!
Helena,Female,"Leon, the plane!"
Jake,Male,Him again!?
Leon,Male,Friend of yours?
Jake,Male,More like an ex-girlfriend. Guy doesn’t know when to quit.
Leon,Male,Welcome to the club. You get used to it.
Sherry,Female,Watch out for his arm!
Leon,Male,Got it!
Helena,Female,Now’s our chance. Let’s go! You’ve fought this thing before and you’re still breathing? I’m impressed.
Jake,Male,Are you kidding? I get a kick outta this.
Helena,Female,"You’re not entirely sane, are you? How is he still standing!?"
Sherry,Female,Don’t get me started! But maybe the four of us can stop him once and for all!
Leon,Male,He carries around a spare?
Helena,Female,Give him credit — at least he came prepared.
Jake,Male,Like I said... Indestructible.
Leon,Male,I was hoping you were exaggerating.
Jake,Male,"‘Fraid not. That doesn’t mean we gotta, make things easy for him."
Leon,Male,"Hey, shit for brains! Over here!"
Leon,Male,Sherry!
Sherry,Female,Leon! We’re gonna head to the Kwun Lung Building over in Koocheng! That is where I’m meeting with Simmons!
Leon,Male,"Sherry, listen! Until we get there, I need you to—"
Jake,Male,"Hey! If he is half the man you say he is, he’ll be fine. OK?"
Sherry,Female,You’re right. We should hurry.
Sherry,Female,"Koocheng is up ahead, at the mouth of the river."
Jake,Male,"All right. Come on. You’re worried about Simmons, right?"
Jake,Male,"You’re gonna be fine, OK?"
Jake,Male,Let’s go!
Jake,Male,Was that you?
Jake,Male,Jesus Christ!
Sherry,Female,"Watch out! This day is never gonna end, is it?"
Sherry,Female,Come on!
Jake,Male,(encounters the zombie) He’s back! This prick won’t give up!
Sherry,Female,Watch out! Someone’s shooting at us!
Jake,Male,They’re not shooting at us they’re helping us! Maybe it’s your buddies in the BSAA!
Sherry,Female,I think he’s dead.
Jake,Male,Let’s hope it sticks. Found us another boat!
Sherry,Female,I just saw some sort of light or something in the water.
Jake,Male,(stirring away from the falling poles) Jesus Christ!
Jake,Male,"Oh, come on! Really!?"
Jake,Male,What the hell was that?
Sherry,Female,"I don’t know, but whoever they are, they just saved my life."
Jake,Male,Worst boat ride since the Titanic.
Jake,Male,Shit! Sherry!
Sherry,Female,Jake!
Sherry,Female,"Yes? Almost. All right, we’ll be there as soon as we can."
Jake,Male,"Boss still keeping tabs on you, huh?"
Sherry,Female,...For now.
Jake,Male,Let’s go then.
Sherry,Female,"If Leon was right about Simmons, I want you to run. (Jake scoffs) No matter what happens. Promise me."
Jake,Male,Fine.
Sherry,Female,No! Wait!
Simmons,Male,"Ah, Agent Birkin. Impeccable timing. Kindly take these two into custody, won’t you?"
Sherry,Female,They said you were involved in the terrorist attack. Is it true?
Simmons,Male,"What, are they running down the streets, screaming it to anyone who’ll listen?"
Sherry,Female,Answer me!
Simmons,Male,It’s for the benefit of the United States—and global security.
Leon,Male,I can’t see how killing the president is good for the country.
Sherry,Female,The president’s dead?
Simmons,Male,"Well, we have Leon to thank for that."
Helena,Female,"God damn you, Simmons!"
Simmons,Male,(to his men) Dispose of them.
Sherry,Female,No!
Simmons,Male,Hold your fire! Those two are still of use to us.
Leon,Male,(to Sherry) You need to be more careful.
Jake,Male,"All right, all right, so what’s the plan, hero?"
Leon,Male,You think you can make it to that door?
Jake,Male,Why don’t we just waste them?
Leon,Male,Because I need you to take care of Sherry.
Simmons,Male,Can we wrap this up? I do have better things to do.
Sherry,Female,What are you two gonna do?
Helena,Female,Finish Simmons.
Sherry,Female,(hands Leon a flash drive) There’s information on here that could stop the C-Virus. Simmons wants it.
Leon,Male,"Thanks. I’ll put a call in to FOS, get you some protection. Now move!"
Sherry,Female,Go! Run!
Jake,Male,Not a chance.
Sherry,Female,You promised!
Jake,Male,I lied.
Sherry,Female,Jake!
Jake,Male,Sherry!
Sherry,Female,Jake!
Jake,Male,Sherry!
Sherry,Female,I’m sorry. I trusted Simmons. I should’ve been able to see through his lies. This is all my fault.
Jake,Male,"You were just following orders, right? I thought you were doing the right thing. Find the vaccine, save the world and all that."
Jake,Male,What the hell just happened?
Sherry,Female,"Ugh, of course. They took our weapons."
Jake,Male,(looking at a nearby room) Hey! There’s our gear.
Sherry,Female,How do we get in there?
Jake,Male,Good luck.
Sherry,Female,Thanks.
Jake,Male,Sherry!
Sherry,Female,I’m all right!
Jake,Male,"You sure, ’cause you don’t look all right. Hey, break down the door! Save me from climbin’ through those air ducts."
Jake,Male,"Not bad, for a girl."
Sherry,Female,...My pleasure.

Sherry,Female,Reserve battery?
Jake,Male,Where the hell is it?
Sherry,Female,Won’t know ’till we find it.
Computer,,Reserve battery 1 activated. 25% Charged.
Jake,Male,We gotta get more? Dammit!

Sherry,Female,We have to find a way to stop this.
Jake,Male,That crane might do the trick!
Jake,Male,"I’m fresh out of patience, pal!"
Jake,Male,Sherry! You all right?
Sherry,Female,"Yeah, I’m fine! Hurry!"
Jake,Male,Jump!
Sherry,Female,Chris!
Chris,Male,Glad to see you’re OK.
Sherry,Female,"Wait, was that you who just freed us?"
Jake,Male,Looks like you guys saved the day again.
Chris,Male,(to Jake) I can see your father in you.
Sherry,Female,How did you know where—
Jake,Male,"Wait, hold on a second. So you knew him?"
Chris,Male,Yeah. I did. And I’m the one that killed him.
Jake,Male,(swiftly pulls out a pistol) It was you?
Chris,Male,That’s right.
Piers,Male,(aiming at Jake) Chris!
Jake,Male,You better put a leash on that puppy.
Chris,Male,"(waves Piers) This is between me and him. (to Jake) Go ahead, shoot. You have every right to. Just promise me you’ll survive. The world depends on it."
Jake,Male,(angerly) Who the hell are you to tell me what to do!?
Sherry,Female,Stop it!
Piers,Male,Put your gun down! Now!
Jake,Male,"Tell me, were you just... ...following orders, or was it personal?"
Chris,Male,Both.
Sherry,Female,"Jake, please, stop!"
Piers,Male,...before I put a bullet in your head! Just put your gun down.
Sherry,Female,Don’t do this!
Jake,Male,There are more important things at stake than you and me.
Piers,Male,We gotta go!
Sherry,Female,Jake!
Jake,Male,I know!
Sherry,Female,"Guys! I think this is some sort of lift! There’s one over there, too! Let’s get outta here."
Computer,,HAOS Release Simulation ”Infection Rate 20%... 60%... Infection Rate 100%
Jake,Male,What the hell is this?
Piers,Male,The end of the world.
Chris,Male,Unless we stop it.
Sherry,Female,So if that giant cocoon hatches...
Chris,Male,...We’re in trouble.
Piers,Male,Just a bit. We gotta get outta here and warn HQ!
Chris,Male,This way!
Sherry,Female,Gimme a hand!
Jake,Male,"Just so we’re clear, you and I are not done talking yet. You’ve got a lot of explaining to do."
Chris,Male,"We make it outta here alive, and I’ll tell you whatever you want. I just hope you’re ready to hear it."
Jake,Male,"Save the bullshit. I’m not the same man my father was. But if it ever comes down to you and me, it’ll be me, got it?"
Chris,Male,Loud and clear.
Piers,Male,"(to Sherry) Your friend’s a little unpredictable, isn’t he? Must make it hard to rely on him. Not that the Captain’s been a walk in the park lately."
Sherry,Female,"No one’s perfect, but I trust him. Anyway, all we can do right now is focus on getting out of here."
Piers,Male,Good point.
Chris,Male,Look out!
Sherry,Female,Chris!
Chris,Male,Get moving! We got it from here.
Jake,Male,Let’s go.
Sherry,Female,Wait!
Jake,Male,You’ve got a job to finish.
Sherry,Female,There is no way they can take that thing!
Jake,Male,We are not going back.
Sherry,Female,But they’re gonna get killed!
Jake,Male,"Then that’s their choice! It’s a sacrifice they’re willing to make, and we can’t stop them."
Sherry,Female,Jake…
Jake,Male,You know what? I’m not my father. And I’m gonna make damn sure that it stays that way. We’re getting outta here... ...and you’re gonna save the world.
Sherry,Female,You’re right. Let’s go.
Jake,Male,"I’m through with this, where’s the exit?"
Sherry,Female,We’ve gotta be close.
Jake,Male,"Well, look who’s back."
Jake,Male,"Enough of this cat and mouse bullshit. Come get some, you ugly son of a bitch!"
Jake,Male,"Sherry, we gotta take this fight somewhere else!"
Sherry,Female,"Let’s do it! (sees Ustanak) Oh, crap!"
Jake,Male,"Just keeps on uppin’ his game! Nice hit, Sherry!"
Jake,Male,"Yeah, this is much better! Yeah, make more lava holes, you freakin’ idiot!"
Sherry,Female,He doesn’t care. He’ll do whatever it takes to kill us! Jake! Go for it! Now!
Jake,Male,This is more like it! Let’s settle this mano a mano!
Jake,Male,Is that all you got?
Sherry,Female,I’ll cover you!
Jake,Male,Thanks! (to Ustanak) Gotta be quicker than that! Ha-ha! Missed me! Gotta say… I was expecting more! Gotta be quicker than that!
Jake,Male,Good riddance.
Jake,Male,Let’s get outta here!
Sherry,Female,We finally killed him.
Jake,Male,...Piece of cake. We’re in some kind of warehouse. There’s gotta be a way to move shit in and out!
Sherry,Female,Right.
Sherry,Female,"(barely hanging on) Whoa, this is fast!"
Jake,Male,"Yeah, and there’s no goddamn steering."
Jake,Male,Christ almighty! What does it take to lose this guy!?
Sherry,Female,Come on! We have to move further up.
Jake,Male,"Jesus, take the hint!"
Sherry,Female,"Jake, keep going!"
Jake,Male,Hey! Check out the cargo! You thinking what I’m thinking?
Sherry,Female,I am now! Come on!
Jake,Male,"Take that, asshole!"
Sherry,Female,Enough already! You’re not getting him!
Jake,Male,"One more for you, you sack of shit!"
Jake,Male,"Ah, fuck."
Sherry,Female,Jake! Look! A gun!
Jake,Male,"Well, what are we waiting for?"
Jake,Male,This shit ends now!
Jake,Male,"You saved me... You know that, don’t you? Thank you."
Sherry,Female,"(offscreen) Jake Wesker’s blood sample was handed over to the UN’s leading researchers, along with 6 months worth of test results retrieved from Neo-Umbrella’s archives. With the data now in the right hands, things seem to be finally settling down. Following Jake’s rescue, BSAA officials classified his relationship to Albert Wesker as top secret, recognizing the threat it could pose to global security."
Jake,Male,“I lowered my asking price… to 50 dollars.”
Chris,Male,Another round!
Piers,Male,Hard to find a good steak around here. Not like back home.
Chris,Male,Fill her up!
Bartender,,You’ve had enough.

Chris,Male,Who the hell are you?
Piers,Male,Piers... Piers Nivans.
Chris,Male,Never heard o ‘ya.
Piers,Male,How ‘bout this? You heard of this?
Chris,Male,What is that?
Piers,Male,"You really don’t remember anything, do you? Bioterrorism."
Chris,Male,Bio...
Piers,Male,"You can’t hide from your past, Chris, no matter where you go or what you do."
Chris,Male,Who are you? What is this?
Piers,Male,OK… You don’t remember me? Well how about them?
Piers,Male,"Look! I said look! Those were your men! Men who died under your command! You owe it to them to remember, Chris. If you walk away now, then this was all for nothing!"
Chris,Male,Enough!
Piers,Male,"Damn it! Six months of searching for you, and this is what I find!"
Chris,Male,BSAA…

Piers,Male,It’s not personal. You know the mission takes priority.
Chris,Male,This building isn’t gonna last long! Hurry! Piers! Go around it!
Piers,Male,Roger!
Piers,Male,Captain?
Chris,Male,Finn...
Piers,Male,He was running recon. Alone.
Chris,Male,"Listen up! In the BSAA, our job is to rid the world of bioterrorism, and the only way we’re gonna do that is by-sticking together."
Piers,Male,Nobody’s expendable.
Chris,Male,"Exactly. Now each and every one of you may be ready to die for our cause, but it’s my job to make sure we all get through this alive."
Piers,Male,"Suck it up, Finn!"
Finn,Male,"Sorry, sir."
Chris,Male,"No one gets left behind, not on my watch. Understood?"
Squad,,"Yes, sir!"
Piers,Male,"Finn, give us the update."
Finn,Male,"Yes, sir! The guerrillas are using a new species of B.O.W. Command is calling them “J’avo.” They are extremely intelligent, incredibly strong, and have the ability to mutate in response to physical trauma. All right, you know the drill. We split into three teams. Move out!"
Squad,,"You got it! Yes, sir!"
Chris,Male,"(to Finn) You’re the rookie, huh?"
Finn,Male,"Yes, sir. Finn Macauley, sir."
Chris,Male,"I know you’re nervous, Finn, but the team’s got your back. OK?"

Radio,,"You’re sitting ducks out here, Alpha. Get inside that building."
Chris,Male,Are these the new species HQ was warning us about?!
Piers,Male,Bullets don’t even phase ’em... This ain’t our normal class of enemy!
Piers,Male,I didn’t know they came in extra large! How many new species are there!?
Chris,Male,"Finn! We’ve got a huge B.O.W. on our tails! I need the A.P.C.’s firepower, now!"
Finn,Male,"Removing the barricade now, sir! I’ll be there as soon as I can!"
Chris,Male,Alpha to HQ. Our route’s blocked by a B.O.W.

Finn,Male,Dammit! There all over us!
Piers,Male,Use the A.P.C. for cover! Hurry! Get behind it! Find cover! We’ll be torn apart in the open!
Finn,Male,I’ll use the A.P.C. to get through that fence! I think I hit an anti-tank mine! The A.P.C.’s busted!
Piers,Male,Finn! Get over here! I need you to blow this fence!
Finn,Male,I’m on it sir! Setting charges now!

Finn,Male,Copy that! I’ll take point!
Finn,Male,Captain! Over here!
Chris,Male,"I owe you one, Finn. How’s our injured friend?"
Finn,Male,Still with us! I’m going to administer first aid!
Radio,,"Alpha Team, come in! There’s an old T-42 tank moving on your position. Looks like it’s had some modifications."
Finn,Male,"They’re bringing out the big guns for us. Be careful, Captain!"
Chris,Male,I’m gonna need a bigger gun.
Piers,Male,"Captain! If you draw the tank out of position, I can take care of that truck!"
Chris,Male,"Nice shooting, Piers!"
Piers,Male,(to his squad) The way is clear. We better catch up with Captain Redfield. Let’s go.
Chris,Male,I’m heading for the upper level of the bridge. Meet me up on top. Piers! I’m gonna lower the ladder. Come on up!
Chris,Male,"Enemy reinforcements are moving Finn, I need you here!"
Finn,Male,(via radio) I got a Bravo here that can’t walk! Go on without me for now!
Chris,Male,No one on this team gets left behind.
Piers,Male,"We’ll hold our positions for now! I don’t care if you have to drag him, just get your butts up here!"
Finn,Male,"Yes, sir! On my way!"
Piers,Male,We’ve gotta keep this bridge secure until Finn gets back.
Squad,,Roger!
Piers,Male,Finn! Report your current location!
Finn,Male,"I’m at the bottom of the ladder, sir! Almost there!"
Finn,Male,"Here, sir!"
Piers,Male,"OK, time to get to work!"
Chris,Male,We need to cut off their reinforcements. I want you to blow the bridge.
Finn,Male,"Yes, sir! I’ll get started planting the explosives!"
Piers,Male,"All right, make it quick!"
Finn,Male,It’s all set to blow!
Chris,Male,"Everyone, fall back and find cover!"
Piers,Male,Captain! We’ve got a railway gun in play!

Chris,Male,Sherry Birkin? You were in Raccoon City.
Sherry,Female,How do you know that?
Chris,Male,Claire.
Sherry,Female,Wait... Are you Chris?
Chris,Male,My sister’s told me all about you.
Piers,Male,"Chris, that man is a wanted insurgent."
Sherry,Female,"Yes, he’s a mercenary. But right now he’s under the protection of the U.S. government. He’s no threat to the BSAA."
Jake,Male,Unless someone pays me to be.
Piers,Male,What did you just say?
Jake,Male,What?
Chris,Male,Nothing.
Radio,,HQ to Alpha Team. Reinforcements are unable to land due to anti-aircraft artillery. Take ’em out!
Chris,Male,"Alpha Team, copy."

Chris,Male,"We’ll talk later. Right now, you need to find cover."
Radio,,"Alpha Team, come in. This is Echo. Those three anti-aircraft turrets are holding us at bay."
Chris,Male,"Roger that, Echo. We’ll take care of them for you."
Finn,Male,Our first target’s over here!
Sherry,Female,Chris! We’ll give you a hand!
Chris,Male,Out of the question! You need to get to safety!
Sherry,Female,"Don’t worry about me. I can handle myself, and you need the help!"
Jake,Male,Christ... My chances of survival were higher when I was a soldier of fortune.
Finn,Male,"I’m setting charges on-the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! Just need a little more time! The charges are set! Everyone get back!"
Radio,,Only two guns left!
Finn,Male,"OK, head to the next target! I’m setting charges on the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! Just need a little more time! The charges are set! Everyone get back!"
Radio,,"Good job, Alpha! One gun left! There’s another giant B.O.W. closing in on your location!"
Piers,Male,It’s the one we lost at the Two of Hearts!
Chris,Male,Alpha! Prepare to engage!
Piers,Male,Only one to go! Everyone into that underground passage!
Finn,Male,"I’m setting charges on the anti-aircraft guns now, but it’s gonna take a while. See if you can buy me some time! I need you to distract that giant B.O.W.! I can’t work with that B.O.W. around! Just need a little more time! I’m setting the charges now! The charges are set! Everyone get back!"
Radio,,"Good work out there, Alpha! Echo Team will be landing shortly."
Chris,Male,I already gave the pilot the coordinates.
Sherry,Female,Thank you so much for your help.
Chris,Male,(to Jake) Hey... Hey! Have we met?
Jake,Male,"You jarheads all look the same to me pal, sorry."
Piers,Male,You’ve gotta be kidding me!
Chris,Male,My mistake. Have a safe flight.
Piers,Male,"Captain, we’re crazy for letting him walk away! How many men have we lost to mercenaries like him!"
Chris,Male,He’s not our problem. We can’t lose sight of the BSAA’s mission.
Finn,Male,"To fight bioterrorism, sir."
Piers,Male,"I know what we’re here for, rookie."
Chris,Male,"OK, spread out. Search this place top to bottom."
Finn,Male,Are these… people?
Piers,Male,I’m picking up life-form readings. It’s like they’re in cocoons.
Finn,Male,Who’s there!? Over here! I’m getting a reading on the other side of this door!
Chris,Male,"Piers, Finn - you’re with me. Everyone else, keep searching out here."
Piers,Male,"(radio) HQ, three of us are splitting off from the group. Heading further into the building."
Piers,Male,"One of them’s hatching, sir!"
Chris,Male,Call it in to HQ!
Piers,Male,Roger!
Piers,Male,B.O.W.s neutralized.
Chris,Male,"Search the rest of the place, but stay on your guard."
Piers,Male,Captain.
Voice,,“C-Virus.” That’s what the guerrillas were calling it.
Ada,Female,Nice to see the cavalry’s here.
Piers,Male,Who are you?
Ada,Female,I work here. My name’s Ada Wong. They held me hostage.
Chris,Male,C-Virus. That must be what’s creating those J’avo.
Ada,Female,"Yeah, I heard them saying something about that."
Piers,Male,What else did you hear?
Ada,Female,Maybe you could put your guns down first?
Chris,Male,Not until you give us a reason to.
Ada,Female,Neo-Umbrella.
Chris,Male,Neo-Umbrella?
Ada,Female,The organization supporting the guerrillas. Or at least I think that’s what they were calling themselves.
Piers,Male,So the C-Virus came from them.
Ada,Female,That’s all I know.
Chris,Male,Thank you. We appreciate your cooperation. Finn. You’re in charge of keeping her safe.
Finn,Male,"Yes, sir!"
Chris,Male,(whispers to Piers) Keep an eye on her.
Piers,Male,Will do.
Chris,Male,We’ve found one of the staff. Returning to the foyer now.
Ada,Female,Come on. I’ll show you a quick way back to the entrance.
Ada,Female,There’s a way out on the second floor. I suggest we take it. Your friends are having a hard time.
Finn,Male,"Ma’am, please, just try to stay out of the way. We can’t advance unless we eliminate these hostiles! It’s too dangerous to advance with these hostiles around! All hostiles eliminated! Let’s move!"
Ada,Female,This door leads to the warehouse next door. We can get outside through there.
Chris,Male,"We’re almost out. Just hold it together, people."
Finn,Male,"Yes, sir."
Piers,Male,The woman - she’s gone. Finn!
Finn,Male,(confused) I don’t know what happened. She was here a second ago!
Chris,Male,Ada!
Ada,Female,Thanks for the escort. Here’s something to remember me by.
Chris,Male,"No… No, goddamn it! No! Finn, hang in there! Not like this!"
Finn,Male,(mouthful) Captain!
Chris,Male,"Finn! No, goddamn it!"
Piers,Male,"Captain, we gotta move!"
Piers,Male,Now! We gotta go!
Piers,Male,Chris!
Chris,Male,Piers...
Piers,Male,Sir?
Chris,Male,What happened to Ada Wong?
Piers,Male,You remember! Captain?
Chris,Male,Where is she?
Piers,Male,She’s leading Neo-Umbrella. All these terrorists are-
Chris,Male,Is she in this city or not!
Piers,Male,"She’s been sighted several times since the attacks began. Yeah, she’s here."
Chris,Male,Tell the men we’re moving out.
Piers,Male,"Yes, sir."
Chris,Male,"(thinking) Damn you to hell, Wong."
Chris,Male,Shit!
Chris,Male,(radio) Alpha to HQ! We re engaging a hostile!
Chris,Male,Piers! Marco! Everyone on me! We’re going after that thing!
Piers,Male,"You heard the man, people. Let’s move! Go!"
Piers,Male,"OK, let’s move in, but be careful."
Chris,Male,Assume battle positions!
Piers,Male,They’re alive! They went missing six months ago in Edonia.
Piers,Male,Neo-Umbrella’s after them! Captain!
Chris,Male,Spread out! (quietly and as if to himself) Take every one of those damned things down.
Radio,,"Captain, it’s Marco. That’s an armored chopper they’ve brought in."
Radio,,That rules out conventional arms.
Radio,,We need to protect those two down there.
Chris,Male,Forget the chopper for now. Engage the J’avo.
Radio,,"Captain, Keaton here. I can’t reach those two on the radio. They’re not responding. What should we do?"
Chris,Male,"We wipe out the hostiles. After that they’re on their own. I’ve never seen a mutation like that before. Reid, uplink a reading to HQ."
Radio,,"Already on it, sir. Careful! These suckers can really jump!"
Radio,,Don’t let up! These assholes have killed enough for one day!
Chris,Male,Cover them! Drop all of those J’avo!
Piers,Male,(radio) We still got a few left! That’s the last one! The chopper’s pulling back!
Chris,Male,"That’d be too easy. C’mon, keep moving."
Piers,Male,"(radio) Captain, we should escort those two outta here. They’ll never survive on their own."
Chris,Male,We’re moving out. Let’s go!
Radio,,We’re gonna blow the door. Get ready!
Piers,Male,The chopper’s back to finish the job!
Piers,Male,"(radio) HQ, come in! This is Alpha! The chopper is targeting us now!"
Chris,Male,Everyone! Bring that chopper down and bring it down hard!
Piers,Male,"Captain, we can’t let them go!"
Chris,Male,Our mission is to terminate the B.O.W.s.
Piers,Male,But Neo-Umbrella is after them. Shouldn’t we--
Chris,Male,"I said, our mission is to terminate the B.O.W.s. I’m going after that B.O.W. Ada’s not getting away with this."
Piers,Male,"Captain, please, you need to think things through."
Piers,Male,(radio) Alpha Team to HQ. We’re in pursuit of the target.
Chris,Male,That’s the target!
Piers,Male,"Captain, wait! What the hell were you thinking, pulling a kamikaze stunt like that!?"
Chris,Male,(keen) These are my men. You follow my lead or I’ll find someone who will.
Piers,Male,Do you even hear yourself?
Chris,Male,"Fall in line, soldier."
Piers,Male,You heard the man. Let’s move.
Chris,Male,Shut up and keep moving!
Chris,Male,This shit’s in the way! Give me a hand!
Chris,Male,"Everyone, report in!"
Piers,Male,(radio) Piers here. I’m on the third floor.
Chris,Male,"Get a hold of yourself, Marco! Where are you?"
Chris,Male,Target is on the second floor! You all need to come here - now!
Chris,Male,Reid! Goddamn it.
Chris,Male,"Marco, don’t move. Hold your position! Do you hear me? That’s an order!"
Chris,Male,"OK, we find that piece of shit and we put it down - fast and hard!"
Chris,Male,Jeff! Poor bastard.
Piers,Male,Ceiling!
Chris,Male,About time you showed your ugly face.
Chris,Male,You killed my men!
Piers,Male,"I think it went through there, Captain."
Chris,Male,I’m taking you down! It’s gone. After it!
Piers,Male,I know that thing is in here. Time to put an end to this.
Chris,Male,"Die, you sack of shit!"
Chris,Male,After it!
Piers,Male,Its hide has toughened up or something! Our weapons aren’t doing anything!
Chris,Male,Then we have to find something that will!
Piers,Male,Marco! I need power for this thing!
Marco,Male,I’m on it!
Piers,Male,Marco! Are you OK? Marco!
Piers,Male,Well… at least we got it.
Chris,Male,But no Ada yet. I’m not gonna rest until we have her head on a stick.
Piers,Male,This is crazy! It’s not safe in here. We need to pull out! Captain!
Ada,Female,"Looking for me, boys? Welcome to China."
Chris,Male,Ada!
Piers,Male,Wait! We’ve got no choice — we have to kill him! He’d do the same for us.
Piers,Male,Marco!
Piers,Male,"Chris, we need to stay calm."
Chris,Male,After what she’s done to us? How many of our men are dead because of that bitch!
Piers,Male,"I’m right there with you, Captain, but you’re personal vendetta isn’t gonna get us anywhere. If you hadn’t been blinded by vengeance, we could have prevented some of those deaths."
Chris,Male,Shut up.
Piers,Male,Do you even care about our mission anymore?
Chris,Male,SHUT UP!
Piers,Male,I feel sorry for all the men that died believing in you.
Piers,Male,"What happened to the legendary Chris Redfield, huh? What happened to you! It’s a good thing Finn’s not around to see you this way."
Chris,Male,"I’m going after Ada. (radio) HQ, this is Alpha Leader. I need a location on Ada Wong..."
Piers,Male,I’m going with you. Someone’s gotta keep an eye on you... whether you want them to or not.
Radio,,"This is HQ! We’ve got the location for you. Ada Wong has left the city and is heading south for the harbor. HQ to all teams, target Ada Wong has been spotted, heading south for the harbor. We want her alive."
Chris,Male,"You wanna follow me around, fine. Just make sure you stay out of my way."
Piers,Male,"As long as you don’t cross the line again, that won’t be a problem. Ada’s just playing with you. When are you gonna realize that?"
Chris,Male,I’m not stupid enough to fall for her bullshit. You should have a little more faith in your captain.
Chris,Male,Ada!
Piers,Male,"Captain, get a hold of yourself! That helo's about to open up on us! We're sitting ducks out here! We need to find cover!"
Chris,Male,Dammit!
Piers,Male,You gotta be kidding me!
Chris,Male,Don’t talk! Just run! Keep moving!
Piers,Male,If we can just get to that building!
Chris,Male,(radio) Alpha to HQ! We got a visual on Ada Wong. We're in pursuit!
Radio,,"This is HQ. Ada Wong has been spotted moving down the canal. Charlie and Delta Teams, form a perimeter around Koocheng."
Chris,Male,"(to Piers) All right, we can drop that chopper from here."
Chris,Male,Let's go!
Chris,Male,That's that. Now we get Ada.
Piers,Male,Copy that.
Chris,Male,She's here!
Piers,Male,Think this is where they've been developing the C-Virus?
Chris,Male,Ada!
Chris,Male,You can't run forever!
Piers,Male,Alpha Team to HQ! Come in! We are in pursuit of Ada Wong!
Chris,Male,"No use hiding, Ada."
Chris,Male,Make a run for the elevator! Go!
Leon,Male,(from another room) We're not alone in here.
Helena,Female,(from another room) Probably whoever was shooting at Ada. One more thing to worry about.
Ada,Female,Glad you could stop in. Like what I've done with the place? Hope you enjoy your stay. (evil laugh)
Chris,Male,"Laugh while you can, Ada... Cause you're going down."
Piers,Male,What the hell is all this...?
Chris,Male,Keep your eyes peeled. Who knows what this bitch has in store...
Chris,Male,We're locked in.
Computer,,Engaging locks. Testing for prototypes.
Chris,Male,Ada!
Ada,Female,We've been conducting such fascinating work here. Why don't you have some fun with one of the new prototypes?
Piers,Male,Her little bag of tricks isn't going to stop us!
Chris,Male,Keep those damn things back! I'll get the lock.
Computer,,Security breach detected in Room One. Disengaging locks in Room One.
Chris,Male,Let's move! There's no time to waste!
Piers,Male,Someone doesn't want us to catch Ada. She might not be working alone.
Chris,Male,"Give it up, Ada. It's over!"
Ada,Female,"Oh, is the big, bad soldier going to shoot me?"
Chris,Male,"Stand down, Piers!"
Piers,Male,Captain! Get a hold of yourself!
Ada,Female,It's been fun. Ciao.
Chris,Male,Ada! Don't lose her!
Piers,Male,I won't!
Chris,Male,Ada!
Helena,Female,(nearby) Your friend likes to play hard to get. She always been like this?
Chris,Male,(to Piers) There she is! Cut her off!
Piers,Male,I've got her!
Leon,Male,Chris!
Chris,Male,Leon? What are you doing here?
Leon,Male,"Put your gun down, Chris. She's a key witness, we need her."
Chris,Male,A witness!? She's the one who did all this!
Leon,Male,"No! It wasn't her - it was Simmons, the National Security Advisor."
Chris,Male,I lost all my men because of her!
Leon,Male,"And I lost over 70,000 people, including the president, because of Simmons!"
Chris,Male,She's working for Neo-Umbrella. You know what that means?
Leon,Male,"Yeah, I do."
Chris,Male,And you're still going to protect this woman?
Leon,Male,I am.
Piers,Male,Captain!
Piers,Male,Freeze!
Piers,Male,Damn it! (runs after Ada)
Leon,Male,Helena!
Helena,Female,He's gonna kill her!
Leon,Male,"Chris, wait! We both want the same thing here."
Chris,Male,All right. The BSAA will handle Ada. You take care of Simmons.
Leon,Male,Chris. I know you'll do the right thing.
Piers,Male,She's making a break for the harbor. Get in!
Chris,Male,"Hey, Piers. What you said, about me hiding from my past. You were right."
Piers,Male,Captain?
Chris,Male,Can you catch up to her?
Piers,Male,Won't stop until I do.
Piers,Male,(radio) This is Piers Nivans! Ada Wong is moving south towards the military port! Advising all personnel to be on the alert! (to Chris) Don't bother! We can handle this!
Chris,Male,I've had enough of these stupid games!
Chris,Male,Chris to HQ! Block of all the exits!
Radio,,"Sorry, no can do. All of our units are currently engaged. I don't have any to spare."
Piers,Male,Dammit! Do you think this is part of her plans? Give up Ada! We got you! You're not getting rid of us that easily! I'm the best driver the BSAA's got!
Radio,,"Alpha, come in! This is Delta! We hear you're zeroing in on Ada Wong! We're trying to hold out on our end, but we ain't gonna last long! You've gotta catch that woman, before this gets any worse!"
Chris,Male,Don't worry soldier! We will! You just keep those civilians safe!
Radio,,Roger that! Good luck! Hopefully we can put an end to this shit storm! Delta out!
Piers,Male,Captain! There's a train coming!
Chris,Male,"Hey! Grab your gun! I'm taking the wheel! Hang on! I'm taking a short cut! There we go! She's not getting away again. You're not gonna lose us, Ada!"
Radio,,HQ to Alpha! We've spotted an aircraft carrier of unknown origin in the harbor. Chatter we've picked up indicates it might belong to Neo-Umbrella.
Piers,Male,Then that's where Ada's headed! We can't let her reach it!
Chris,Male,Hold on! I'm gonna jump it!
Chris,Male,Piers!
Piers,Male,"I'm good, captain!"
Chris,Male,Keep your head down! They've got their sights locked on us! Careful. These enemies are different.
Piers,Male,"So these are Neo-Umbrella's finest, huh?"
Chris,Male,(radio) Alpha to HQ. We're closing in on Ada Wong.
Radio,,HQ here. Copy that.
Piers,Male,We have to figure out where on board she's hiding.
Chris,Male,"We need to get up those stairs. Hurry, we can't let her get away."
Piers,Male,"Well, that's just great, what else can go wrong? How the hell are we supposed to get the bulkhead open?"
Chris,Male,We'll figure something out. That's our job. You and I have a mission to complete. Got it?
Piers,Male,"Yeah, I got it. Maybe we can blow it open."
Chris,Male,Hey Piers! I found somethin' to take care of that bulkhead!
Chris,Male,"Piers, you OK?"
Piers,Male,"Yeah, I'm fine."
Chris,Male,Just keep going. We'll meet up eventually.
Chris,Male,Now that's how you open a door.
Piers,Male,"HQ, come in. We're continuing our mission to apprehend Wong."
Chris,Male,"Now, let's get those stairs back down."
Chris,Male,I'm going for it.
Piers,Male,Roger that!
Radio,,HQ to Alpha. Fighting in the city has spread. You need to apprehend Ada Wong now.
Chris,Male,Copy that. Tell our boys to hang in there.
Piers,Male,Are you kidding me!?
Chris,Male,I think we've overstayed our welcome.
Ada,Female,"Can you feel it spreading through your body yet? I'm just giving you exactly what you gave me, Simmons. At first you'll be afraid, but don't worry. You're just becoming the monster you always were. You and everyone else on the planet. You and your Family may have shaped the world into what it is today, but starting tomorrow, it's all going to change."
Piers,Male,It's Ada!
Chris,Male,"Ada, stop!"
Piers,Male,Found her!
Chris,Male,Upstairs - move!
Piers,Male,"Dammit, she's toying with us!"
Chris,Male,I'll take care of these guys.
Chris,Male,Ada!
Ada,Female,"Still haven’t had enough, huh? Even after losing all your men - again? With your track record I gotta say, I'd hate to be a member of your team, Chris."
Piers,Male,"Don't listen to her, Captain."
Ada,Female,"But where are my manners? I mean, really, I should be thanking your men… ...foreing such good test subjects."
Chris,Male,"Ever since Edonia, all I've wanted is to see you dead. But this isn't about vengeance, it's about justice. It's over, Ada."
Ada,Female,"You're right, it is. The aircraft carrier is preparing for launch."
Chris,Male,(to Piers) Launch?
Ada,Female,"And the dead will flood the streets. Déjà vu, boys - Raccoon revisited. But this time, it won't just be one city. It'll be the whole world!"
Ada,Female,You got me. Well played. But no one can stop it now...
Piers,Male,Damn it! What the hell just happened!?
Piers,Male,This looks like a different strain. There are two missing!
Chris,Male,"Just take what's left. We'll bring it back to HQ for analysis. (radio) This is Alpha Leader! I need a report on the missing vessels, ASAP!"
Radio,,"The city has been compromised, and we’ve lost contact with all local assets. We need more time."
Chris,Male,We don't have it! The terrorist assault was just a diversion! The real attack will spread the virus globally!
Piers,Male,Now what?
Chris,Male,Let's check the rear hangar. There have gotta be some planes back there.
Piers,Male,"Yes, sir!"
Radio,,"Alpha Team, this is HQ. We've confirmed that Wong was telling the truth. There's a fully armed aircraft carrier in open water not far from your location. Satellite imaging indicates they're getting ready to fire missiles on the mainland. It's imperative that you stop them from launching even a single one."
Chris,Male,"Copy that, HQ. The bay is just up ahead. Hurry!"
Piers,Male,"Yes, sir!"
Piers,Male,This is makin' me seasick. You think this tub is gonna last much longer?
Chris,Male,I don't want to hang around to find out. Come on!
Chris,Male,Dammit. We need three separate passcodes to get this open.
Piers,Male,"Fantastic. Well, let's go see if we can hunt them down."
Chris,Male,"He's dead. Which means someone else is here. Anyway, we got the first code."
Piers,Male,"Aw come on. Give me a break! Finally! Let's get outta here! Captain! Let's get this thing opened, Captain! I'm ready when you are! Got the second one. Only one more to go. Found the last one. Let's head back."
Chris,Male,Come on!
Piers,Male,Right behind you.
Chris,Male,I don't have time for you right now.
Chris,Male,Let's get it fired up!
Radio,,"HQ to Alpha. The aircraft carrier has been located. The carrier is armed with anti-aircraft artillery. Take out those guns, Alpha."
Piers,Male,One plane against an entire carrier? Does that even sound possible?
Chris,Male,Hey Piers! How's your aim?
Piers,Male,"Never better, Captain!"
Radio,,"Prelaunch preparations have already begun, and there's nothing we can do to stop it from here."
Piers,Male,"The missile's carrying a virus. if it hits, it's gonna be a hell of a lot worse than a normal warhead. And the only way we can stop it is by getting on that carrier."
Chris,Male,"We've got no choice. OK, get ready, I'm going in. Ada said she wanted to bring Raccoon City to the world. But there's only one missle that we know of. Come in, HQ. Are there any other vessels in the water?"
Radio,,Negative. Intel says only the carrier.
Piers,Male,She could have been making it up. I wouldn't put it past her.
Radio,,All anti-aircraft guns have been destroyed.
Piers,Male,"All right, now we can stop that missile! Find a place to land, Captain!"
Radio,,HQ to Alpha! The missile countdown has already started. Find the control unit and stop the launch!
Piers,Male,"Roger that, HQ, We're on it! (to Chris) Looks like my path is blocked. Nothin' a little pyrotechnics can't take care of!"
Chris,Male,"OK, I've got you covered."
Piers,Male,That looks like more trouble than we need!
Chris,Male,"Shit. This fight's about to get dirty! Hurry it up, Piers! We're runnin' out of time!"
Radio,,HQ to Alpha. Missile launch has been aborted.
Chris,Male,"Way-to-go, Piers! Now get back to the plane so we can get outta here!"
Piers,Male,Roger that!
Chris,Male,Piers! Get to the crane! I'll pick you up!
Piers,Male,"Hey, Captain! The odds are a little uneven down here. A little help?"
Radio,,"HQ to Alpha, we have an emergency! The missile is preparing to launch!"
Chris,Male,How in the hell!?
Piers,Male,It's Ada. She knew we would try to stop it!
Radio,,"We're out of time, Alpha. Permission to destroy the missile granted!"
Piers,Male,"Dammit, that thing's in our way!"
Chris,Male,"All right, Piers take out those missiles!"
Piers,Male,Roger that!
Piers,Male,It's heading for the city!
Radio,,This is FOS. Is anyone there?
Piers,Male,FOS?
Chris,Male,Chris Redfield with the BSAA here.
Radio,,"Hold on, I'm patching you through to Agent Leon Kennedy."
Chris,Male,"What—? Leon!? Leon, where are you?"
Leon,Male,"(via radio) Chris! We're just outside of Tatchi, why?"
Chris,Male,(screams) Get the hell outta there!
Chris,Male,"Leon!? Leon, are you all right?"
Leon,Male,(via radio) Yeah… But things just got bad. Real bad!
Chris,Male,(punches the wall of the jet) Damn it!
Leon,Male,"(via radio) Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin… ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son."
Chris,Male,Wesker!?
Leon,Male,"(via radio) Chris, he's got antibodies for the C-Virus."
Chris,Male,I got it. On my way.
Leon,Male,(via radio) Good. Thanks.
Chris,Male,"Leon, wait. There's something I need to tell you. (pauses) Ada Wong is dead."
Leon,Male,"(via radio, quietly) Copy. Sherry and Jake need you. Don't let them down."
Chris,Male,Go!
Piers,Male,"There's irony for you. A man who spent his entire life trying to destroy the world, and now… his son is the only one who can save it."
Chris,Male,And here I am coming to rescue him.
Piers,Male,The man who killed his father. Like I said - irony.
Chris,Male,"I don't know, maybe it's fate. It's been 3 years since I killed Wesker. I can't let this war follow me forever. After we rescue Jake, I'm turning in my gun."
Piers,Male,What!? Wait a minute—
Chris,Male,It's about time someone took my place. And I'd be honored if it was you.
Piers,Male,I... I don't think I'm ready for that.
Chris,Male,"You've made it this far, haven't you?"
Chris,Male,All right. This is it!
Piers,Male,Who the hell has the funding to build something like this?
Chris,Male,"It's got Neo Umbrella written all over it. Be careful. Knowing them, there'll be some surprises."
Piers,Male,Copy that.
Piers,Male,Captain!
Chris,Male,All right.
Chris,Male,I think I got it.
Chris,Male,They found us!
Piers,Male,"We gotta go! Captain, can you pinpoint their location?"
Chris,Male,They're in some sort of research bay. We can get there from the lower levels. Let's go get 'em! Piers! I need you to scope out an area for me! Can't get into the air ducts with these blades going. See if you can turn them off from up there.
Piers,Male,"Roger that. OK, it's off."
Chris,Male,Roger. I'm going in.
Piers,Male,"(fighting) Ah, for Christ's sake."
Chris,Male,I'll see what I find here. Wait for my command.
Piers,Male,Roger that.
Chris,Male,"Piers, I've got another set of blades in the way."
Piers,Male,I'm on it: Just give me a minute. It's off. You're good to go.
Chris,Male,"Piers, I've restored power to the elevator."
Piers,Male,Copy. I'll rendezvous with you up ahead.
Chris,Male,Piers! I'm in the elevator. Headed your way.
Piers,Male,"Copy that, Captain."
Computer,,Engaging airlock. Connection to research block initiated. Please wait until the connection is complete.
Ada,Female,Hello stranger.
Chris,Male,…Ada!?
Ada,Female,"Yup. It's me. Or should I say… was me. Consider this my little parting gift to you. If you've made it this far, I'm assuming you are BSAA. Not that it matters. You still won't stop my plan. No one can. One missile and this world will be transformed… ...into a new Eden. For my last… and greatest creation. He will thrive in the ashes of the burning cities… ...conquering all that remains after the fall. He will reign as king of the new era!"
Piers,Male,Something tells me this new creation isn't a pillow pet.
Chris,Male,Piers! Can you get through to HQ?
Piers,Male,No. Not unless we get topside.
Chris,Male,So we're on our own. All right. Let's get Jake and Sherry the hell outta here! Come on!
Piers,Male,Roger!
Computer,,Connection complete. Pressurizing area now. Please wait until air pressure levels have normalized.
Chris,Male,Don't let it pull the lever! Last thing we need is more cocoons!
Piers,Male,Shit! They keep coming!
Chris,Male,We're just gonna have to hold out!
Computer,,Pressure normalized. Connection procedures complete. Disengaging the safety lock.
Piers,Male,"Let's go, Captain."
Sherry,Female,Chris!
Chris,Male,Glad to see you're OK.
Sherry,Female,"Wait, was that you who just freed us?"
Jake,Male,Looks like you guys saved the day again.
Chris,Male,I can see your father in you.
Sherry,Female,How did you know where—
Jake,Male,"Wait, hold on a second. So you knew him?"
Chris,Male,Yeah. I did. And I'm the one that killed him.
Jake,Male,It was you?
Chris,Male,That's right.
Piers,Male,Chris!
Jake,Male,You better put a leash on that puppy.
Chris,Male,"(to Piers) This is between me and him. (to Jake) Go ahead, shoot. You have every right to. Just promise me you'll survive. The world depends on it."
Jake,Male,(in rage) Who the hell are you to tell me what to do!?
Sherry,Female,Stop it!
Piers,Male,Put your gun down! Now!
Jake,Male,"Tell me, were you just… ...following orders, or was it personal?"
Chris,Male,Both.
Sherry,Female,"Jake, please, stop!"
Piers,Male,...before I put a bullet in your head!
Sherry,Female,Just put your gun down. Don't do this!
Jake,Male,There are more important things at stake than you and me.
Piers,Male,We gotta go!
Sherry,Female,Jake!
Jake,Male,I know!
Sherry,Female,"Guys! I think this is some sort of lift! There's one over there, too! Let's get outta here."
Computer,,HAOS Release Simulation Infection Rate 20%... 60%... Infection Rate 100%
Chris,Male,What the hell is this?
Piers,Male,The end of the world.
Chris,Male,Unless we stop it.
Sherry,Female,So if that giant cocoon hatches...
Chris,Male,We're in trouble. Just a bit.
Piers,Male,We gotta get outta here and warn HQ! Hurry! Over here! This way! Hurry!
Piers,Male,"Ya know, you didn't have to put yourself on the line like that. Wesker deserved what he got. You did what was right - you kept this world safe."
Chris,Male,He was still his father. The kid had the right to know.
Piers,Male,"Well, I'll tell ya this much. I can't say I've lacked for adventure working with you."
Chris,Male,"Sorry, I know it's never been easy being my partner. Once we get outta here… all that's gonna change."
Sherry,Female,(via radio) Listen... Jake.
Jake,Male,"(via radio) Spare me the lecture, all right? We need to find a way outta here."
Sherry,Female,"(via radio) I was only trying to – look, when this over, please, just talk to Chris. And not down the barrel of a gun, OK?"
Jake,Male,"(via radio) It's my problem, not yours. Besides, I don't wanna think about that asshole or my father right now. I can worry about them if and when we get outta here."
Chris,Male,Look out!
Sherry,Female,Chris!
Chris,Male,Get moving!

Piers,Male,I gotcha!
Chris,Male,Shit!
Chris,Male,"OK, let's go!"
Piers,Male,That is one angry son of a bitch!
Chris,Male,Releasing this thing must have been Ada's plan from the beginning!
Piers,Male,Jesus! The missiles were only a distraction then!
Piers,Male,You've gotta be kidding me! That thing's still alive?
Chris,Male,Not for long!
Piers,Male,"Shit, this thing won't die!"
Chris,Male,It better. We can't let this thing see the light of day!

Piers,Male,I've been better!
Chris,Male,Son of a bitch!
Piers,Male,"Captain! We're outta time! We gotta go! Argh! Captain, I can't get by! I'll be damned if I'm gonna die here."
Chris,Male,Hurry! Can't hold it…
Piers,Male,"Thanks, Captain!"
Chris,Male,We're sitting ducks in here!
Piers,Male,You're right. We gotta move!
Piers,Male,Captain!
