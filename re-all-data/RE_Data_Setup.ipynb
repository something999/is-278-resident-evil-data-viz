    "# **Analyzing Transcripts in Resident Evil: The Prepwork**\n",
    "## **About this Project**\n",
    "In this project, we'll be analyzing the historical characterization of male and female characters in the *Resident Evil* series by processing fan-made transcripts from [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/) and the [Game Scripts Wiki](https://game-scripts-wiki.blogspot.com/p/resident-evil-series.html) and perform numerical analyses on these transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How many games does that project entail?\n",
    "With ten mainline releases and three remakes (as of 2024), we'll be looking at transcripts for **thirteen** *Resident Evil* games. In the interest of transparency, here are all of the games we are including in our analysis:\n",
    "* [*Resident Evil 0*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_Zero) (2002)\n",
    "* [*Resident Evil 1*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_(1996_video_game)) (1996)\n",
    "* [*Resident Evil 2*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_2) (1998)\n",
    "* [*Resident Evil 2* Remake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_2_(2019_video_game)) (2019)\n",

    "### Why focus on *Resident Evil*?\n",
    "We chose to focus on the *Resident Evil* games because of their theme and their history; the *Resident Evil* franchise has been around since 1996 and focuses on survival horror, a genre that typically explores unequal power dynamics (monster versus humans and human versus human). We thought that *Resident Evil* transcripts would provide some interesting historical data on how male and female characters have been portrayed in games and whether the notions of games being a male-dominated space have actually changed in recent decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But why focus on male and female characters? Isn't gender more complex?\n",
    "While we acknowledge that gender is not strictly binary, the *Resident Evil* series doesn't prominently feature character who identify outside of the male-female binary. Most of the characters are identified with he / him or she / her pronouns (and in some cases, it / its pronouns if the character's gender identity is unspecified). To the best of our knowledge, none of the characters in the *Resident Evil* games are explicitly identified as non-binary, agender, or genderfluid characters. Since we are trying our limit our focus to historical analysis, we are choosing to only use canon gender identities, which results in us adhering to that strict gender binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You mentioned using fan-transcribed dialogues for the analysis. Why not extract the data directly from the game yourselves?\n",
    "The simple answer is that our team lacks the resources to perform direct textual extraction from the games. No one in our team owns the entire *Resident Evil* series; in fact, out of the whole team, only two of us have played a *Resident Evil* game. We are thus relying on fan-transcribed dialogues to gather the data for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you haven't played a *Resident Evil* game, why are you choosing to look at *Resident Evil*?\n",
    "We feel that a familiarity with a game shouldn't be a limiting factor when conducting an analysis. While personal passion can enchance an analysis, the reality is that we are sometimes called to do projects that lie outside our our immediate interests and expertise; I, for instance, would rather explore topics like game taxonomy than character dialogues. But we believe that gender representation in games is an important issue that warrants exploration -- and *Resident Evil* transcripts give us a means of exploring that subject matter."

    "## **Step 1: Extracting the Data**\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier in this notebook, we're compiling our initial dataset from [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/) and the [Game Scripts Wiki](https://game-scripts-wiki.blogspot.com/p/resident-evil-series.html). We accomplished this part of the project by copying and pasting data from webpages into .txt files.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why we didn't automate this process. When we attempted to scrape data from the websites, some of our scraping attempts were blocked for unidentifiable reasons. Out of concern, we checked the `robots.txt` files but found that data extraction was permitted; we were not violating any website usage agreements. In the interest of time, we decided it would be best for us to manually collect the data and clean it later in the project, rather than try to come up with a working automated solution.\n",

    "### Retrieving the Lines of Dialogue from the Transcripts\n",
    "We know from skimming the transcripts that the dialogues are formatted in the format `SPEAKER: LINE`, where `SPEAKER` is the name of a character (i.e. \"Barry\") and `LINE` is that character's line of dialogue (i.e. \"That was too close. You were almost a Jill sandwich.\") Based on this pattern, we can create a **regular expression (regex)** that finds and matches lines in the format and use the [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) module to get those matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our regex is `^[A-Z]{1}[A-Za-z '.]+:{1}(.+[\\n|\\r\\n|\\r])*`. It'll match any line with the following characteristics:\n",
    "* The first part of the sentence must contain a word that begins with a capital letter and is followed by one or more letters, spaces, or apostrophes\n",
    "* The second part of the sentence must contain a character followed by a newline character\n",
    "* Both parts of the sentence must be separated by exactly one colon\n",
    "\n",
    "As an unintended consequence, this method will also capture lines that are formatted like dialogue but are not actually lines of dialogue. For example, the line \"To: Emily\" would be captured by the above regex, even though the line represents an email or letter header. Such mistakes should be captured and removed during the data validation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To save time, we're going to perform preliminary data cleanup while we attempt to extract the lines of dialogue. If we find any lines that match the `SPEAKER: LINE` format, we are going to:\n",
    "* Remove extraneous carriage return characters (`\\n`, `\\r`, and `\\r\\n`) and spaces\n",
    "* Remove extraneous punctuation (i.e. extra quotation marks around lines of dialogue that have been added in by transcribers for stylistic reasons)\n",
    "* Standardize the spelling of character names such that every part of the name is capitalized (i.e. \"JILL\" becomes \"Jill\" and \"Woman in red\" becomes \"Woman In Red\")\n",

    "Role assignment is subjective. Our perception of a character's importance is often influenced by the amount of time we spend with them. For example, some players might view Sheva as a protagonist in *Resident Evil 5* because she is a controllable character and a persistant ally. But *Resident Evil 5*'s plot generally focuses on Chris's past; Sheva's exists to guide and assist Chris. Sheva thus could be considered a deuteragonist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same idea applies to villains. To give another example, Annette Birkin in *Resident Evil 2* and its remake could be considered a minor antagonist or supporting character depending on how players interpret Annette's actions and whether players hold Annette responsible for the events of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are we skipping certain playable characters? Isn't the definition of playable \"controllable\"?\n",
    "While the term \"playable\" does refer to any controllable character, characters who are controllable for brief periods of time typically have minimal impact on the game and the plot. Wesker, for instance, is technically a playable character but is only controllable in a special mode in certain games.\n",
    "\n",
