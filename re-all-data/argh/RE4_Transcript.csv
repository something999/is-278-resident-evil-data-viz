Leon,Male,"1998... I'll never forget it. It was the year when these grisly murders occurred in the Arklay Mountains. Soon after, the news was out to the whole world revealing that it was the fault of a secret viral experiment conducted by the international pharmaceutical enterprise, Umbrella. The virus broke out in a nearby mountain community, Raccoon City. And hit the peaceful little town with a devastating blow crippling its very foundation. Not taking any chances, the President of the United States ordered a contingency plan - to sterilize Raccoon City. With the whole affair gone public, the United States government issued an indefinite suspension of business decree to Umbrella. Soon its stock prices crashed and for all intents and purposes Umbrella was finished. Six years had passed since that horrendous incident..."
Leon,Male,I received special training via a secret organization working under the direct control of the President. I was to assume the responsibility of protecting the new President's family.
First Cop,,Why am I the one who always gets the short end of the stick?
Second Cop,,"Yo, who are you really? Come on and tell us. You are a long way from home, cowboy. You have my sympathies."
Leon,Male,"Guess that's a local’s way of breaking the ice. Anyway, you know what this is all about. My assignment is to search for the President's missing daughter."
First Cop,,"What, all by yourself?"
Leon,Male,"I'm sure you boys didn't just tag along so we could sing Kumbiyah together at some Boy Scout bonfire. Then again, maybe you did."
Second Cop,,"Oh, you crazy American. It's an direct order from the chief himself. I tell you it's no picnic."
Leon,Male,I'm counting on you guys.
Leon,Male,"It was right before I was to take on my duties of protecting the President's daughter when she was abducted. That's the ultimate reason I'm in this lonely and rural part of Europe. According to our intelligence, there's reliable information of a sighting of a girl that looks very similar to the President's daughter. Apparently she's being withheld by some unidentified group of people. Who would have thought my first job would be a rescue mission?"
Second Cop,,"Ah, it's freezing. So cold all of a sudden."
Second Cop,,"Ah, must be my imagination."
Second Cop,,Sorry it took so long.
First Cop,,Just up ahead is the village.
Leon,Male,I'll go and have a look around.
Second Cop,,We'll stay and watch the car. Don't want to get any parking tickets.
Leon,Male,Right...parking tickets.
First Cop,,Good luck.
Leon,Male,"Geez, who are these guys?"
First Cop,,Did you say something?
Hunnigan,Female,"Leon, I hope you can hear me. I'm Ingrid Hunningan. I'll be your support on this mission."
Leon,Male,"Loud and clear. Somehow I thought you'd be a little older. So the subject's name's Ashley Graham, right?"
Hunnigan,Female,"That's right. She's the daughter of the President. So try and behave yourself, okay?"
Leon,Male,"Whoever this group is, they sure picked the wrong girl to kidnap."
Hunnigan,Female,I'll try to find more information on them from my end as well.
Leon,Male,Good. Talk to you later. Leon out.
Leon,Male,"Uh, excuse me. Sir?"
Leon,Male,I was wondering if you might recognize the girl in this photograph?
Don Esteban,Male,"Qué carajo haces aquí? Lárgate, cabrón! (What the hell are you doing here? Get out of here!)"
Leon,Male,Sorry to have bothered you.
Leon,Male,Freeze! I said freeze!
Leon,Male,Shit!
Hunnigan,Female,Is everything okay?
Leon,Male,There was a hostile local. I had no choice but to neutralize him. There are still others surrounding the area.
Hunnigan,Female,Get out of there and head toward the village. Take whatever measures necessary to save the subject.
Leon,Male,Understood.
Leon,Male,"Oh, no..."
Hunnigan,Female,Leon. How ya holding up?
Leon,Male,"Bad question, Hunningan."
Hunnigan,Female,Sorry to hear that...I'm sending you a Playing Manual. Hope you find it useful.
Leon,Male,I'll take a look at it. Thanks.
Leon,Male,Damn it!
Leon,Male,Who are these people?
Leon,Male,What are they planning?
Leon,Male,Great. A chainsaw.
Leon,Male,Shit!
Don Esteban,Male,Lord Saddler...
Leon,Male,Where's everyone going? Bingo?
Leon,Male,"Hunnigan, I have some bad news. I've confirmed the body of an officer. Something's happened to the people here."
Hunnigan,Female,"Leon, you need to get out of there. Look for a tower. Follow the trail near it."
Leon,Male,Got it.
Luis,Male,"A little rough, don't you think?"
Luis,Male,You're...not like them?
Leon,Male,No. You?
Luis,Male,"Okay. I have only one, very important question. You got a smoke?"
Leon,Male,Got gum.
Luis,Male,Perfect. The big cheese.
Leon,Male,What?
Occult Leader,,Feeble humans. Let us give you our power.
Occult Leader,,"Soon, you will become unable to resist this...intoxicating power."
Leon,Male,Hey. Hey. Wake up.
Luis,Male,"Ai yi yi. Crawl out of one hole, and into another."
Leon,Male,You want to tell me what's going on here?
Luis,Male,"Americano, si? Now what brings a bloke like you to this part of the world? Easy, whoever you are."
Leon,Male,"My name's Leon, I came here looking for this girl. Have you seen her?"
Luis,Male,"What, are you supposed to be a cop or something? Nah, you don't look the type."
Leon,Male,Maybe.
Luis,Male,"Okay, Let me guess. She's the President's daughter?"
Leon,Male,That's too good for a guess. Want to start explaining?
Luis,Male,"Psychic powers. Nah, just kidding with you, amigo."
Luis,Male,I overheard one of the villagers talking something about the President's daughter in the church.
Leon,Male,And who might you be?
Luis,Male,"Me llamo Luis Sera. I used to be a cop in Madrid. Now I'm just a good-for-nothing guy, who happens to be quite the ladies' man."
Leon,Male,Why'd you quit?
Luis,Male,"Policia...you put your life on the line, no one really appreciates you enough for it. Being a hero isn't what it's cracked up to be anymore."
Leon,Male,Used to be a cop myself. Only for a day though.
Luis,Male,I thought I was bad.
Leon,Male,"Somehow I managed to get myself involved with the incident in Raccoon City, on my first day in the force."
Luis,Male,That is the incident with the viral outbreak right? I think I might have seen a sample of the virus in the lab at my department.
Ganado,,(speaking Spanish)
Luis,Male,"Do something, cop!"
Leon,Male,After you!
Leon,Male,Now!
Leon,Male,It's Leon. Sorry I couldn't get in touch sooner but I was a bit tied up.
Hunnigan,Female,"You're okay, right?"
Leon,Male,"I'm fine. There was a male civilian held captive. According to him, Ashley's in a church somewhere."
Hunnigan,Female,What happened to him?
Leon,Male,He managed to escape.
Hunnigan,Female,Do you have a fix on the location of that church?
Leon,Male,"No, but apparently, there's a secret passage in the village that leads there. I'm heading back to the village."
Merchant,,"Over here, stranger."
Merchant,,Got something that might interest ya.
Mendez,Male,"Hmmmm. You carry the blood as us, it seems. Nevertheless, you're an outsider. Just remember, if you become a nuisance to our eyes, you face severe consequences."
Leon,Male,What? Same blood?
Hunnigan,Female,Leon. I've been able to get some new info that might help you.
Leon,Male,Fill me in.
Hunnigan,Female,"Apparently, there's a religious cult group involved. They're called the Los Illuminados."
Leon,Male,"Los Illuminados? That's a mouthful. Anyway, I've had an unexpected run-in with the big cheese of this village."
Hunnigan,Female,"But you're okay, right?"
Leon,Male,"Yeah... But he could have killed me, but he let me live... And he mentioned something about me carrying the same blood as them. Whatever that means."
Hunnigan,Female,Carrying the same blood... Hmm... Interesting...
Leon,Male,"Anyway, there are more important things than solving riddles right now."
Hunnigan,Female,"You're right. Hurry and find that church, Leon."
Hunnigan,Female,Leon. Have you reached the church yet?
Leon,Male,"Ah...well, yeah. Sort of..."
Hunnigan,Female,"Leon, did I mention not to take the scenic route? At any rate, Ashley's inside that structure. Rescue her. Hurry!"
Leon,Male,"Hunnigan, it's Leon. The door's locked. I can't get in."
Hunnigan,Female,Didn't they teach you how to pick locks at the academy?
Leon,Male,There's some sort of indentation like something might fit inside.
Hunnigan,Female,"Well, there's no use standing around. Leon, you have to find some way or something to get inside."
Leon,Male,What's that?
Leon,Male,Shit.
Hunnigan,Female,Leon. It's been 6 hours since our last transmission. I was starting to get worried.
Leon,Male,"Don't you mean lonely? Anyway, I started to feel dizzy. And then I guess I must have lost consciousness."
Hunnigan,Female,Lost consciousness? Maybe it has some connection to what the village chief was talking about...?
Leon,Male,Can't say. But I'm all right now. I'm gonna continue my mission.
Leon,Male,I've obtained an object that resembles the cult group's insignia.
Hunnigan,Female,"Wonderful, Leon. Head back to the church. Ashley's safety is our immediate priority."
Ashley,Female,Don't come!
Leon,Male,"Hey, take it easy!"
Ashley,Female,No! Get away!
Leon,Male,"Calm down. Everything's going to be just fine. My name's Leon, I'm under the President's order to rescue you."
Ashley,Female,What? My father?
Leon,Male,"That's right, and have to get you out of here. Come with me."
Leon,Male,It's Leon. I've succeeded in extricating my subject.
Hunnigan,Female,"Good work, Leon. I'll send a chopper over right away."
Leon,Male,What's the extraction point?
Hunnigan,Female,There's another trail that you can take to get out of the village. The chopper will pick you up beyond there.
Leon,Male,Got it. I'm on my way.
Saddler,Male,I'll take the girl.
Leon,Male,Who are you?
Saddler,Male,"If you must know, my name is Osmund Saddler, the master of this fine...religious community."
Leon,Male,What do you want?
Saddler,Male,"To demonstrate to the whole world, our astounding power, of course. No longer will the United States think they can police the world forever. So we kidnapped the President's daughter, in order to give her our power, and then send her back."
Ashley,Female,No...
Ashley,Female,"Leon, I think they shot something in my neck."
Saddler,Male,"We just planted her a little...gift. Oh, there's going to be one hell of a party when she returns home to her loving father. (laughs) But before that, I thought I might bargain with the President for some...donations. Believe it or not, it takes quite a lot of money to keep this church up and running."
Leon,Male,"Faith and money will lead you nowhere, Saddler."
Saddler,Male,"Oh, I believe I forgot to tell you that we gave you the same gift."
Leon,Male,When I was unconscious.
Saddler,Male,"Oh, I truly hope you like our small, but special contributions. When the eggs hatch, you'll become my puppets. Involuntarily, you'll do as I say. I'll have total control over your minds. Don't you think this is revolutionary way to propagate one's faith?"
Leon,Male,Sounds more like an alien invasion if you ask me!
Leon,Male,You okay?
Ashley,Female,"Leon, what's going to happen to us?"
Leon,Male,"Don't worry, we got into this mess, we can get out of it."
Hunnigan,Female,"Leon, I have some bad news."
Leon,Male,I'd rather not hear it.
Hunnigan,Female,"Well, I'm afraid I have to tell you anyway. We've lost contact with the chopper. Somebody must have shot it down though, we can't determine who."
Leon,Male,Great...
Hunnigan,Female,"We're prepping another chopper for you. Meanwhile, I want you to head towards the extraction point."
Leon,Male,Got it.
Ashley,Female,"What are we gonna do, Leon?"
Leon,Male,"I hate to say it, but we're sandwiched all right. Quick, in that cabin!"
Luis,Male,Leon.
Luis,Male,"Small world, eh? Well, I see that the President's equipped his daughter with ballistics too."
Ashley,Female,How rude! And I don't believe there's any relevance with my figure and my standing. Who are you?
Luis,Male,"Ho ho, excuse me, Your Highness. Perhaps the young lady might want to introduce herself first before asking someone his name?"
Ashley,Female,"Her name's Ashley Graham, the President's daughter."
Luis,Male,"Is she, you know?"
Leon,Male,Don't worry. She's cool.
Luis,Male,"Ehh, nevermind. There's supposed to be some obvious symptom before you turn into one of them anyway."
Ashley,Female,Look!
Leon,Male,"Ashley, upstairs!"
Luis,Male,Okay...it's game time.
Ganado,,Vamanos.
Leon,Male,Looks like they're backing off.
Luis,Male,"So, what do we do now?"
Leon,Male,"The bridge I crossed to get here is out, so I guess we have no choice but to keep moving."
Luis,Male,I forgot something. You guys go on ahead.
Leon,Male,Luis.
Leon,Male,"You'd better stay outside. Ashley, go hide."
Ashley,Female,Yeah.
Leon,Male,Hasta luego.
Ashley,Female,"Are you okay, Leon?"
Leon,Male,On the other side of the bridge!
Ashley,Female,Yeah.
Leon,Male,You take that one.
Ashley,Female,Okay.
Leon,Male,Ready?
Leon,Male,Come on.
Ashley,Female,Yeah.
Hunnigan,Female,"Leon, what's your current location?"
Leon,Male,"We decided to lay low in a castle, but it looks like it was a bad move."
Hunnigan,Female,Meaning?
Leon,Male,Well it appears that this castle's also connected with the Los Illuminados. They must not get many visitors cuz they're giving me one hell of a welcome.
Hunnigan,Female,"Sounds bad. I have an idea, Leon. I need you to--"
Leon,Male,"What? Repeat, Hunnigan."
Leon,Male,Great. Just my luck.
Luis,Male,Leon!
Leon,Male,Luis.
Luis,Male,I've got something for you guys.
Luis,Male,"Uh... What?! Oh, shit! I must have dropped it when I was running away from them."
Ashley,Female,Dropped what?
Luis,Male,"A drug that'll stop your convulsions. Look, I know you are carriers. You've been coughing up blood, right?"
Leon,Male,...Yeah.
Luis,Male,And you?
Ashley,Female,Yes.
Luis,Male,Damn it! The eggs have hatched. We don't have much time.
Leon,Male,What are you talking about?
Luis,Male,I have to go back and get it.
Ashley,Female,Let me come with you.
Luis,Male,"No, you stay here with Leon. He is better with the ladies. I'm sure."
Leon,Male,Why are you--
Luis,Male,It makes me feel better. Let's just leave it at that.
Salazar,Male,I was starting to wonder when you might notice us.
Leon,Male,Who are you?
Salazar,Male,"Me llamo Ramon Salazar, the eighth Castellan of this magnificent architecture. I have been honored with the prodigious power from the great Lord Saddler. I've been expecting you, my brethren."
Leon,Male,"No thanks, bro."
Salazar,Male,"My my, we've got a feisty one. If you care for your own well-being, I suggest you surrender yourself and simply...become our hostage. Or, Mr. Scott, you can give us the girl, since you're not worth a penny, I'm afraid. You can die."
Ashley,Female,I'm never turning into one of them! Never!
Leon,Male,Got that right. We'll find a cure.
Leon,Male,You all right?
Ashley,Female,I'm fine! Leave me alone!
Leon,Male,"Ashley, wait!"
Leon,Male,Ashley!
Ashley,Female,What's going on!?
Leon,Male,"Don't worry, Ashley! I'm coming for ya!"
Leon,Male,"Hunnigan, what happened? The transmission got cut off."
Leon,Male,Salazar! How'd you...?
Salazar,Male,We've jacked the line. We didn't want you telling everyone any unnecessary information.
Leon,Male,Where's Ashley?
Salazar,Male,"Aw... So she fell into one of our wonderful traps. We'll make sure we find her. Don't you worry about her. Oh, yes. I let out miserable insects out for some excercise down in the sewer."
Leon,Male,Thanks. That should keep me company. Cuz boredom kills me.
Salazar,Male,I look forward to our next encounter... In another life.
Salazar,Male,"What a pleasant surprise. But I'm afraid it's Ashley we need, not you, Mr. Kennedy."
Leon,Male,"If you don't need me, then get off my back, old man!"
Salazar,Male,"Did you say old man, Mr. Kennedy? It might come as a surprise, but I'm only twenty years old."
Leon,Male,So you're just like all the others. A puppet of the parasites?
Salazar,Male,"Surely you don't think I'm the same as those diminutive Ganados. The parasites, Las Plagas are slaves to my will. I have absolute control."
Leon,Male,"Well, I really don't give a damn. Rain or shine, you're goin' down."
Salazar,Male,Get rid of our American friend.
Salazar,Male,"Mr. Kennedy. Still alive, I see. So, do you like my garden?"
Leon,Male,I see you've managed to work in a little of your twisted taste here too.
Salazar,Male,"Sagacious as I am, even I get lost here sometimes. Even if it takes your whole life, you'll never get out. Do you know that no one dies without a cause? You will satisfy the stomachs of my cute pets. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to tie up a few loose ends. Like chasing down a couple of rats."
Leon,Male,Two rats...? If one's Luis... Who's the other? There an intruder besides me?
Ada,Female,Put your hands where I can see them.
Leon,Male,"Sorry, but following a lady's lead just isn't my style."
Ada,Female,Put them up now.
Leon,Male,Bit of advice - try using knives next time. Works better for close encounters.
Ada,Female,"Leon. Long time, no see."
Leon,Male,Ada... So it is true.
Ada,Female,True? About what?
Leon,Male,"You, working with Wesker."
Ada,Female,I see you've been doing your homework.
Leon,Male,"Why, Ada?"
Ada,Female,What's it to you?
Leon,Male,Why are you here? Why'd you show up like this?
Ada,Female,Heh.
Ada,Female,See you around.
Leon,Male,Ada!
Luis,Male,Leon! I got it.
Leon,Male,Luis!
Saddler,Male,"Now that I have the sample, you serve me no purpose."
Leon,Male,Saddler!
Saddler,Male,My boy Salazar will make sure you follow the same fate.
Leon,Male,"Stay with me, Luis."
Luis,Male,I am a researcher...hired by Saddler. He found out what I was up to.
Leon,Male,Don't talk.
Luis,Male,Here. It should suppress growth of the parasite. The sample...Saddler took it. You have to get it back.
Leon,Male,Luis! LUIS!
Ashley,Female,Talk about near death experience.
Leon,Male,"Ashley, get out of there!"
Ashley,Female,The door's locked! I can't open it!
Ashley,Female,I got the key! I can get out!
Ashley,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,Ashley!
Leon,Male,You did good.
Ashley,Female,I'm sorry if I was...
Leon,Male,"Don't worry about it. Come on, let's move on."
Salazar,Male,Aw...what a touching moment we have here.
Leon,Male,All spoiled thanks to your interruption. Why don't you do us all a favor and leave before the audience gets pissed off?
Salazar,Male,"You're nothing but an extra in my script, so don't get too carried away. Your biggest scene is over."
Leon,Male,I don't ever remember being a part of your crappy script.
Salazar,Male,"Well then, why don't you show me what a first-class script is like: Through your own actions."
Salazar,Male,I think you've lived long enough. Lets see if you can survive this time.
Ashley,Female,No!
Ashley,Female,Leon! Help!
Leon,Male,Damn it! Ashley!
Leon,Male,Great. More of them.
Salazar,Male,"I wonder if you can see me, Mr. Kennedy?"
Leon,Male,"If you scratch her, I'll break your bones."
Salazar,Male,"First, we'll see if you can make it this far. I'll be waiting."
Leon,Male,Shit!
Leon,Male,Ashley.
Ashley,Female,Leon!
Salazar,Male,"Mr. Kennedy, don't you know when it's time to throw in the towel?"
Ashley,Female,"No, Leon!"
Salazar,Male,Hmm...where's the satisfying sound of one's impalement?
Leon,Male,Won't fall for this old trick.
Salazar,Male,Aah! How dare you! No more games! Kill him!
Salazar,Male,KILL!
Salazar,Male,Quickly! We shall prepare for the ritual!
Ashley,Female,Leon...you're alive.
Salazar,Male,"So maybe you have nine lives. But it doesn't matter now, Mr. Kennedy! I've sent my right hand to dispose of you."
Leon,Male,Your right hand comes off?
Salazar,Male,"Say whatever you please. Die, you worm!"
Saddler,Male,"It seems that Salazar is having difficulty taming the American pig. Salazar had his chance. Krauser, go get the girl.  Oh, and dispose of this swine while you're at it."
Krauser,Male,Consider it done.
Salazar,Male,"So nice you could join us, Mr. Scott Kennedy."
Leon,Male,You again.
Salazar,Male,"The sacred rite that is about to begin at this tower will bestow the girl with magnificent power. She will join us, become one of us."
Leon,Male,This is no ritual. This is terrorism.
Salazar,Male,"Isn't that a popular word these days? Not to worry, we've prepared a special ritual just for you."
Leon,Male,Heh.
Leon,Male,Stop!
Salazar,Male,"Ah, you've just missed her. The ritual is over. She left with my men to an island."
Leon,Male,What?
Salazar,Male,I think it's time I paid my due respects towards to your impressive and stubborn will. Mr. Kennedy...welcome!
Leon,Male,Monsters. I guess after this there'll be one less to worry about.
Ada,Female,"Need a ride, handsome?"
Leon,Male,Hmph. Okay...
Ada,Female,Got some business to take care of. See you later.
Leon,Male,Women.
Leon,Male,I hate to break it out to you but Salazar's dead.
Saddler,Male,"Yes, it seems that way."
Leon,Male,"Saddler, why don't you give up and let Ashley go home?"
Saddler,Male,Perhaps you are disillusioned with overconfidence just because you killed my small-time subordinate?
Leon,Male,"Saddler, you're small time."
Saddler,Male,"Writhe in my cage of torment, my friend."
Ashley,Female,Help me Leon!
Leon,Male,Ashley.
Leon,Male,"Heh. Amateurs. Just hang in there, Ashley. I'm coming for ya."
Leon,Male,"This is Leon. Request backup. Repeat, request backup."
Leon,Male,Damn!
Ashley,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,You okay?
Leon,Male,"Come on, let's get out of here."
Leon,Male,Looks like this is it.
Ashley,Female,"Ugh, it stinks."
Leon,Male,Sure does.
Ashley,Female,"No way, Leon."
Leon,Male,Way.
Ashley,Female,Are you out of your mind?
Leon,Male,I knew you'd be fine if you landed on your butt.
Ashley,Female,You...!
Ashley,Female,What is this?
Leon,Male,"Come on, let's go."
Ashley,Female,What is that thing?!
Saddler,Male,I can feel them. Growing ever so strongly inside you.
Leon,Male,Saddler!
Saddler,Male,"Perhaps you can resist, but you cannot disobey."
Saddler,Male,"Now, come to me, Ashley."
Krauser,Male,"What's the news on our friend, Leon?"
Ada,Female,He's not making it easy. The sample?
Krauser,Male,Saddler's got it. It seems he's sniffed out our little game.
Ada,Female,Perfect.
Krauser,Male,"Just so we understand each other clearly, I don't trust you. Nor does Wesker. If you try to do anything clever, I will kill you."
Ada,Female,"Is that so? You know, I met Wesker long before you."
Krauser,Male,We'll see soon enough if you did.
Ada,Female,Yeah. We'll see.
Krauser,Male,Heh.
Krauser,Male,"Been a long time, comrade."
Leon,Male,Krauser!
Krauser,Male,I died in the crash two years ago. Is that what they told you?
Leon,Male,You're the one who kidnapped Ashley!
Krauser,Male,"You catch on quick. That's expected. After all, both you and I know where we come from."
Leon,Male,What do you want?
Krauser,Male,"Hmph. The sample Saddler developed, that's all."
Leon,Male,Leave Ashley out of this!
Krauser,Male,"Oh, I needed her to buy Saddler's trust in me. Like you, I'm American."
Leon,Male,You got her involved just for that?!
Krauser,Male,All for Umbrella's sake.
Leon,Male,Umbrella?
Krauser,Male,"Almost let it slip. Enough talk. Die, comrade!"
Leon,Male,Ada!
Krauser,Male,"Well, if it isn't the bitch in the red dress."
Ada,Female,It looks like we have the upper hand here.
Krauser,Male,"You may be able to prolong your life, but it's not like you can escape your inevitable death, is it?"
Ada,Female,You...knew each other?
Leon,Male,More or less. Maybe it's about time you told me the reason you're here?
Ada,Female,Maybe some other time.
Saddler,Male,Enjoy the reunion with your old friend?
Leon,Male,"As a matter of fact, I did."
Saddler,Male,Wonderful. I wouldn't want my special guests on the island feeling unattended.
Leon,Male,"Guess I'm supposed to thank you, right?"
Saddler,Male,"Ah...I have an idea. Since you're here, why don't I introduce you to it. It should keep you busy."
Leon,Male,"Can't remember the name? A senior moment, perhaps."
Saddler,Male,Enjoy the fun.
Leon,Male,Ashley...
Leon,Male,What is that?
Krauser,Male,"So, you two are all hooked up now, is that it?"
Leon,Male,Where's Ashley?
Krauser,Male,Do you really want to know? She's beyond that gate. But you'll need three insignias to open it.
Leon,Male,"What are you gonna do, Krauser?"
Krauser,Male,There's one in the north...
Krauser,Male,..and another in the east.
Leon,Male,And let me guess...you got the last one.
Krauser,Male,It pretty much means you're on a tight leash.
Leon,Male,Sounds like you thought this one out pretty well.
Leon,Male,"What do you intend to do, restoring Umbrella?"
Krauser,Male,To bring order and balance to this insane world of ours.
Leon,Male,A psycho like you can't bring order or balance.
Krauser,Male,"You don't seriously think a conservative mind can chart a new course for the world, do you?"
Krauser,Male,Don't just stand there. Come out and fight like a man!
Leon,Male,I'm not falling for that one.
Krauser,Male,Just trying to have fun.
Krauser,Male,"What is it that you fight for, comrade?"
Leon,Male,"My past, I suppose."
Krauser,Male,Hmph. Umbrella.
Leon,Male,"Two down, one more to go, Krauser."
Krauser,Male,Hmph. We'll see about that.
Krauser,Male,Witness the power!
Leon,Male,"You've lost it completely, Krauser."
Krauser,Male,"Prepare for your death, Leon."
Saddler,Male,"So, it seems you killed Krauser too. How should I return my appreciation?"
Leon,Male,Wha? What are you talking about? I thought he was with you.
Saddler,Male,"What are you talking about? Did you really think I'd trust an American? To tell you the truth, I was contemplating how to get rid of him. But thanks to you, that's no longer necessary."
Leon,Male,You were just using him right from the start.
Saddler,Male,"Oh, I must hand it to you... You've demonstrated a bit of promise by killing Krauser. When your assimilation with Las Plagas is complete, I'll have you serve as my guard."
Leon,Male,"Unfortunately, I'm going to have to decline your generous offer. I have prior engagements."
Saddler,Male,Hmph. Enjoy your smart mouthing while you can.
Leon,Male,Damn!
Leon,Male,Hey. It's about time.
Pilot,,"Sorry, bad traffic. I'll cover you."
Leon,Male,Now that's what I call backup.
Pilot,,The name's Mike. You looking for firepower you've come to the right place.
Mike,Male,Take cover!
Leon,Male,"Thanks. When we get out of here, drinks are on me."
Mike,Male,"Yeah! Hey, I know a good bar!"
Leon,Male,MIKE!
Leon,Male,"I'll make sure you're the next to go, Saddler!"
Saddler,Male,"Oh, I'm sorry, Leon."
Leon,Male,"Saddler, you bastard!"
Saddler,Male,"It's nothing to get all upset about. Don't tell me you've never swatted a bothersome fly. In essence, it's the same thing."
Leon,Male,What'd you say?! Insects' life doesn't compare to human lives!
Saddler,Male,"When you acquired this power, you too will understand."
Leon,Male,Guess it's another good reason to get his parasite out of my body.
Saddler,Male,I wish you luck.
Ada,Female,"Leon, you okay?"
Leon,Male,Yeah.
Leon,Male,"Sorry, Ada."
Ada,Female,We have to get that parasite out of your body.
Leon,Male,"Yeah. But before that, I have to save Ashley."
Ada,Female,Fine. Let's split up.
Saddler,Male,"You'll soon harbor an awesome power. Yet it seems, you would rather choose death."
Leon,Male,"I'm taking Ashley back, whether you like it or not."
Saddler,Male,"Ah, the audacity of youth."
Ada,Female,"Leon, now!"
Ada,Female,Move!
Leon,Male,Let's go!
Ashley,Female,"This hunk of junk? I don't know about this, Leon."
Leon,Male,There's only one way to find out. You operate.
Ashley,Female,Are you sure you want to do this?
Leon,Male,Yeah.
Ashley,Female,Alright. Here goes nothing.
Ashley,Female,How are you feeling?
Leon,Male,Like a million bucks.
Ashley,Female,I thought you were gonna die. Alright. Guess I'm up.
Leon,Male,You okay?
Leon,Male,"I don't know about you, but I think it's time we go home."
Leon,Male,"Something's not right. Ashley, you stay here."
Leon,Male,Ada!
Leon,Male,Hmph.
Saddler,Male,Huh?!
Leon,Male,"Better try a new trick, because that one's getting old."
Leon,Male,You okay?
Ada,Female,I've been better.
Leon,Male,What's so funny?
Saddler,Male,"Oh, I think you know. The American prevailing is a cliché that only happens in your Hollywood movies. Oh, Mr. Kennedy, you entertain me. To show my appreciation, I will help you awaken from your world of clichés."
Leon,Male,"Ada, stand back!"
Ada,Female,Use this!
Ada,Female,"Sorry, Leon. Hand it over."
Leon,Male,"Ada, you do know what this is."
Ada,Female,Don't worry. I'll take good care of it.
Leon,Male,Ada!
Ada,Female,"Gotta go. If I were you, I'd get off this island too."
Leon,Male,She really pushed it!
Ada,Female,"Here, catch."
Ada,Female,Better get a move on. See you around.
Leon,Male,Very cute.
Ashley,Female,Leon.
Leon,Male,We have to get off this island now! It's gonna blow any minute.
Ashley,Female,It's gonna what?!
Leon,Male,"Hang on, sweetheart!"
Ashley,Female,Waves! Behind us!
Leon,Male,I know! Just hold on!
Leon,Male,"Ashley! Ashley, where are you?!"
Ashley,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,Come on. Let's go home.
Ashley,Female,"Sounds like a great idea. Mission accomplished! Right, Leon?"
Leon,Male,Not quite. I still have to get you home safe.
Ashley,Female,"So, after you take me back to my place, how about we do some...overtime?"
Leon,Male,Heh. Sorry.
Ashley,Female,"Somehow I knew you were going to say that, but it doesn't hurt to ask, you know. So, who was that woman anyway?"
Leon,Male,Why do you ask?
Ashley,Female,Come on. Tell me.
Leon,Male,She's like a part of me I can't let go. Let's leave it at that.
