Helicopter Loudspeaker,,Non-Playable,You need to disperse immediately!
Witness,,Non-Playable,"He was knocked unconscious, he had severe lacerations all over his face—"
Government Official,,Non-Playable,The CDC has quarantined the lower mid-western region of the USA—
Jill,Female,Playable,Fucking hell… Gets worse every night... (looking at marked calendar) Three more days. Then I can kiss this town goodbye.
Jill,Female,Playable,Who could that be? Hello?
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,Jill! A-Are you OK?
Jill,Female,Playable,Brad? Is that you?
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,Listen! You gotta get out of there!
Jill,Female,Playable,What are you talking about?
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,I don't have time to explain. You gotta get out of there RIGHT NOW!
Jill,Female,Playable,Alright. Let me grab my—
Jill,Female,Playable,What the hell is that thing!? Gotta get outta here. What the hell!? No way!
Jill,Female,Playable,OK.
Jill,Female,Playable,What the fuck!?
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,Jill! Over here!
Jill,Female,Playable,Brad!
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,You OK?
Jill,Female,Playable,What was that thing?
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,"Damned if I know. But right now, it's got a hard-on for the only two S.T.A.R.S. left in town: you and me. I'm not stickin' around. Just look around you. The longer we wait, the more screwed we are."
Jill,Female,Playable,How did this all happen so fast?
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,I dunno. But one fucked-up thing always leads to another. It's like Arklay on steroids.
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey! Hey, wait! Down here! Ah, god dammit..."
Jill,Female,Playable,We've gotta be dreaming. How could this many people be infected?
Jill,Female,Playable,Brad! Here they come!
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,In here!
Jill,Female,Playable,There's so many...
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,Door behind you! Go!
Jill,Female,Playable,Brad!
Jill,Female,Playable,Don't think about it. We're gonna make a run for it!
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,"C'mon, Jill. We know how this ends."
Jill,Female,Playable,No. I don't.
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,Are we still a team?
Jill,Female,Playable,Always.
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,Then do me a favor and don't fuck up like I did. Go!
Jill,Female,Playable,"I'm sorry, Brad…"
Jill,Female,Playable,Sorry.
Helicopter Loudspeaker,,Non-Playable,You down there! Get to the parking garage roof!
Jill,Female,Playable,Parking garage. Got it.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Sir, are you alright?"
Dario,Male,Non-Playable,Stay back! Don't come any closer!
Jill,Female,Playable,"Hey, come on. There's a helicopter waiting to take you to safety."
Dario,Male,Non-Playable,What safety? I'm not going out there!
Jill,Female,Playable,The parking garage isn't far. I can take you there.
Dario,Male,Non-Playable,The only safe place is in here!
Jill,Female,Playable,"Sir, what's your name? I can't just leave you behind."
Dario,Male,Non-Playable,"It's Dario Rosso. And yeah, right. You just want to steal my safehouse! Get your own, missy!"
Jill,Female,Playable,“Missy”? Would you please calm down? I'm a police officer. I'm here to help.
Dario,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, yeah, you've been doing-a-bang-up job. You wanna help? Go handcuff yourself to one of those freaks."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Sir, this is your last chance. No one else is coming-for-you."
Dario,Male,Non-Playable,I'm not going anywhere! I'd rather starve to death in here than be eaten by one of those undead-monsters! Now leave me alone!
Jill,Female,Playable,Shit!
Jill,Female,Playable,Come on.
Jill,Female,Playable,Hey! Down here!
Helicopter Loudspeaker,,Non-Playable,"Hey, get in!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"(throwing a dead man out of his car) Sorry… Oh, come on. Start, dammit!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"It's my turn, bitch!"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, fuckface."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, easy lady… I got ya."
Jill,Female,Playable,Who are you? What are you do—
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Name's Carlos and I'm saving you! C'mon, let's get you someplace safe."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,I think we're in the clear.
Jill,Female,Playable,Hope so.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,We've been bringing survivors here.
Jill,Female,Playable,Here where?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,My guys have converted some subway cars into a shelter. It's safe.
Jill,Female,Playable,I’m fine.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Personal space, OK. I get it. Let's go. Aw, c'mon. Who's the dipshit that closed this? Sorry. We're gonna have to go around."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Hey, what do you know about that monster?"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Nothing. I've never seen anything like it. But it's no zombie. It knows what it wants and won't stop till it gets it. Don't you like that in a man?
Jill,Female,Playable,No thanks. He's all yours.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Listen, I promise you're in good hands. I'm with the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service. U.B.C.S. for short."
Jill,Female,Playable,Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? You guys are the ones who caused all of this!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Whoa whoa whoa whoa. What are you talking about? We're just here to help people. What's wrong with Umbrella?
Jill,Female,Playable,What's wrong with Umbrella? Oh my god. Your company is responsible for infecting everyone!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, uh, I don't know anything about all that. You don't have to trust me, but I'm going to the shelter. You comin'? C'mon. It's this way."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Hey Captain. This fine young lady could use our help.
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,"Carlos, you didn't even think to ask fine young lady her name? She is an elite operative of R.P.D. Special Tactics and Rescue Service. Her name is… something... Valentine."
Jill,Female,Playable,It’s Jill.
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,"Nice to meet you, Jill. I am U.B.C.S. Platoon Leader Mikhail Victor. My team was sent here to rescue civilians."
Jill,Female,Playable,Right. How's that going for you?
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,"The city is completely cut off. Isolated. Most of the hundred thousand civilians will wind up dead. Ah, correction: undead. My platoon has suffered serious losses. Just keeping them alive is more than I can manage."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Well, you can thank your corporate overlords for that."
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,"Yes, well... We are doing all we can. If we can get this subway train moving... we can evacuate some survivors. But we need help. My men cannot do this alone."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Alright, I'm in. But I am on their side. Not yours."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh hey, hey, that's cool. We all want the same thing."
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,"Thank you, Jill."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Alright, supercop. Here you go. We can use this to stay in contact."
Jill,Female,Playable,I know what a radio is.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"OK, first things first. We need to get you geared up. Head up to street level. You'll find supplies there."
Jill,Female,Playable,Alright.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(to Mikhail) Shit, Captain. They really took a chunk out of you."
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,Nothing that I will miss.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Jill, it's me again. You topside yet?"
Jill,Female,Playable,Working on it. So what's the plan?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) The old tank's got me clearing the tracks. You mind getting the subway infrastructure back online?
Jill,Female,Playable,And how do I do that?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Let's start by restoring power. I'll navigate you to the substation once you hit the main road.
Jill,Female,Playable,Copy that. Let's do this fast.
Jill,Female,Playable,It almost looks like I could get this working if I plug in the right… whatever it is.
Jill,Female,Playable,More survivors. We've got to get that train moving.
Jill,Female,Playable,Carlos? I've reached the main avenue. Which way do I go?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) See a big transmission tower? That's the substation. You'll have to circle around through an alley to your right to get there.
Jill,Female,Playable,You mean the alley that's on fire?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) ...Maybe? Surely a tall drink of water like yourself can put out a few flames.
Jill,Female,Playable,Fuck you.
Jill,Female,Playable,Gotta put this out.
Jill,Female,Playable,"This must be the subway company's offices. Huh, nothing..."
Jill,Female,Playable,There.
Jill,Female,Playable,Is someone in here?
Jill,Female,Playable,You're U.B.C.S.?
Guy,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah. C-Careful, careful. C'mon don't look at me like that, alright? I'm not an infected!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"OK, let's take care—"
Guy,Male,Non-Playable,No no no wait! Please!
Jill,Female,Playable,What the fuck!
Man,Male,Non-Playable,He was infected.
Jill,Female,Playable,He might have been infected.
Man,Male,Non-Playable,Are all S.T.A.R.S. this soft? No wonder so many of you are dead.
Jill,Female,Playable,And what are you? U.B.C.S.? Killing your own people?
Man,Male,Non-Playable,He would have turned. Where is your sense of self-preservation? Go back to the subway station. We don't need a bleeding heart like you getting in the way.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Ugh, it smells like... Oh, I don't even wanna think about it."
Jill,Female,Playable,Oh my god.
Jill,Female,Playable,Get it out!
Jill,Female,Playable,Fucking gross!
Jill,Female,Playable,Here we go.
Jill,Female,Playable,Done. Time to get the hell outta here.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Oh, come on!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"OK, all that leaves is the main power switch."
Jill,Female,Playable,Enjoy that.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Carlos, it's Jill. I've restored power to the subway"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Nice going! Next up is the traffic control system. It should be in the subway company's offices.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Right, I think I know the building."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Really? Way to go, partner. One step ahead!"
Jill,Female,Playable,Not your partner.
Jill,Female,Playable,Are you shitting me!?
Jill,Female,Playable,"Carlos, that thing is still alive! It's after me!"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) What? Run! Come back to the station!
Jill,Female,Playable,Not until I get traffic control online!
Jill,Female,Playable,"OK, back again. Carlos, I'm in the control room. Now what?"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Nice! Now you gotta plot out a route.
Jill,Female,Playable,"OK, gimme a sec. Alright, where are we headed?"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) The train is stopped at Redstone Street. We need to reach Fox Park Station. Can you program that in?
Jill,Female,Playable,Hey I’m supercop. Consider it done.
Computer,,Non-Playable,Please enter a route.
Jill,Female,Playable,What did he say? Redstone Street to Fox Park...
Computer,,Non-Playable,Valid route confirmed.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Carlos, it's me. I've finished inputting the subway route."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Jill, you are amazing! Tough as nails, too. Hurry back to the station. We'll make sure the subway is ready to depart."
Jill,Female,Playable,What the fuck!?
Jill,Female,Playable,What the hell is it doing to them?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Nice job, supercop. I'm impressed."
Jill,Female,Playable,We back in business?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, mostly. But we need 30 to 40 minutes to finish maintenance."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Nicholai! How we doin'?
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,The town's crawling with those freaks. No chance of fighting our way out of the city. Why is she here?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,She's helping get the trains running again.
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,"Bad time to start carrying dead weight, friend. She's unreliable. Can't pull the trigger when it counts."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, take it easy."
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,She'll get you killed.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Sorry about that. Everyone's a little worked up.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Aw come on. Not again.
Jill,Female,Playable,It's me he's after. I'll buy you some time.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey wait! Wait, Jill! No! God dammit!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Come on, you creepy-ass stalker! You want S.T.A.R.S.!? I'll give you S.T.A.R.S.!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Carlos, do you copy? Carlos! ...Shit. I need to find another way out."
Jill,Female,Playable,A map of the area. Perfect.
Jill,Female,Playable,What was that?
Jill,Female,Playable,Door won't budge. Looks like it needs a power source.
Jill,Female,Playable,Ohhh god. I'm definitely burning these clothes.
Jill,Female,Playable,What the fuck was that!?
Jill,Female,Playable,"Carlos, can you hear me now?"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Jill! Oh, thank god! Everything OK?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Yeah, I'm alive. I lost him."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Great. The subway's ready to go. We'll leave as soon as you make it back.
Jill,Female,Playable,"It can use weapons? I gotta get out, quick!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Alright, let's do this. Maybe I can hit the fuel tank."
Jill,Female,Playable,It's still kicking?
Jill,Female,Playable,"Carlos, it's Jill. Do you read me?"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Loud and clear. You alright?
Jill,Female,Playable,Yeah... Bastard's dead.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Good. Fuck 'im. But what were you thinking, turning yourself into bait? You could've been killed."
Jill,Female,Playable,Don't start I did what I had to..
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) I know. And, uh… thanks. The subway's ready to go. Hurry back."
Kendo,Male,Non-Playable,Don't move! Shit… Jill.
Jill,Female,Playable,Kendo. You're alright.
Kendo,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah well, alright's a stretch. Sorry I got a little jumpy there. Didn't know quite what to expect."
Jill,Female,Playable,"No shit. Look, we're using the subway to get people out of town. You in?"
Kendo,Male,Non-Playable,Subway. Well... That's good thinking.
Jill,Female,Playable,When we get out there's gonna be a lot to do. We could use a man of your skillset. What's wrong?
Kendo,Male,Non-Playable,"Nothin'. Just uh... Just bad timing is all. Look, um… don't worry about me. I'm gonna make other arrangements. OK?"
Jill,Female,Playable,You better. You're the best gunsmith around.
Kendo,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, no."
Jill,Female,Playable,Don't do anything stupid.
Kendo,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh that's—that's your job, right? (smiles) Take care, Jill."
Kendo,Male,Non-Playable,"If you're heading to the station, take that service alley out in front of the shop, OK? The key's hanging on the wall."
Jill,Female,Playable,A rocket launcher? Really!?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Jill, you OK?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Carlos, that monster's on my ass again!"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Are you shitting me? I thought you killed it!
Jill,Female,Playable,Me too!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Jill, you there? I think I know how to slow that fucker down. Head back toward the station!"
Jill,Female,Playable,And lead him right to you?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) It's OK. Trust me!
Jill,Female,Playable,This is insane.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill! This way! Hey, you OK? GO… GO!"
Jill,Female,Playable,C'mon! Forget about him!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,C'mon. Let's get out of here.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Carlos, I know we didn't get off to a great start, but… thanks for the save."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, you saved my ass first. You're a hell of a lot braver than me."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Well, what matters is that we can get everyone out of the city now."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Yeah. You'll be safe.
Jill,Female,Playable,What about you?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,From the sound of it. I won't be catching the train.
Jill,Female,Playable,Why not?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"There'll be new orders. If it means I can help save the city, that's fine by me."
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,"Good work. Your reputation is well deserved. Get inside, the subway is about to leave. Carlos, Tyrell. You have your orders. You need to go back out into the city and find Nathaniel Bard."
Jill,Female,Playable,"This isn't the last ride out of town, right?"
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,"Do not worry. Once the civilians are safe, the train will be back."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"It's alright, you go on ahead. I'm not gonna die on you, and leave you in a cold, cruel, Carlos-less world."
Jill,Female,Playable,OK.
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,You need to find this scientist. His vaccine research could save us all.
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,(clapping) You see? You're learning. The only life that matters is your own.
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,Good luck. Let's go!
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,"You don't really think a pencil-pusher like Bard is still alive, do you?"
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,I have it on good authority. Why? Are you worried about teammates? Or something else? Funny how brainless zombies can ambush a platoon like that. Funny the gate was locked. Don't you think?
Jill,Female,Playable,What was that?
Jill,Female,Playable,How is this fucker not dead yet!?
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill, no. They're gone. Come. This way."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Nicholai, what are you doing?"
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,It's not after me.
Jill,Female,Playable,Nicholai!
Mikhail,Male,Non-Playable,"Get off my train, shitbird."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,It's been awhile. Subway's gotta be clear of the city by now.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Along with your hot date?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Nah, she's not like that. Hell, she's not like anybody."
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"Alright, keep your head screwed on, Romeo. This is the police station."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Uh, you sure? 'Cause it looks like a cemetery to me."
Marvin,Male,Non-Playable,Brad! Stop!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,T!
Marvin,Male,Non-Playable,"C'mon, man. Not you too."
Marvin,Male,Non-Playable,Sorry…
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Shit! It's locked!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,You stay on the door. I got this fucker. Come get some!
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Leave him! C'mon!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,He's S.T.A.R.S.? That could be useful.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Where'd that cop go?
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"Don't know, don't care. We got a job to do. If our intel's still worth a damn, then Bard's in the S.T.A.R.S. office. Let's find him and take him into custody."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Custody? I thought this was a rescue.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"Carlos, take a look at this. I've located the S.T.A.R.S. office. Remember, Bard had access to Umbrella's darkest secrets. He knows we'll try to keep him under our thumbs."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,So this “search and rescue mission” is really more like find and detain. ...Right. Good to know.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,I’ll open the shutter so you can get through.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,You stay here and find out what's been going on here at the station.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Call ya if I find anything. Hey. Be careful.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, you too, man."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Now here's a weird fuckin' door.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Leave it. We're here for Bard.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,What the hell was that thing? Couldn't have been a zombie. It didn't stick around. Here we go…
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"T, you copy? There's something real nasty in here. I don't know what it is."
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Something nasty? Alright. I'll take a look with the cameras. Watch your six.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"If cameras killed those things, I'd be set. There you are, dickface!"
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Carlos, I've hit a dead end with the terminal here. Gonna head your way."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Copy that.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Better not.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Gotta move. One at a time, take a number. Man, it sucks to be popular. This asshole again!"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Dr. Bard!
Dr. Bard,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, thank god. Do you know how long I've been trying to reach somebody?"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Don't worry, we're gonna get you out of there. Just tell me where you are."
Dr. Bard,Male,Non-Playable,"I'm trapped in a goddamn hospital, surrounded by every kind of abomination... Look, just send in S.T.A.R.S. They're gonna know what to do."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Nah, negative. R.P.D.'s overrun too."
Dr. Bard,Male,Non-Playable,"Then figure it out! Umbrella's gone crazy. They're killing all the researchers. I am the only one who knows how to make the vaccine to stop the zombies... So you can either sit there with your dick in your hand, or send—send somebody who's capable of getting me the hell out of here!"
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,I like him already.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, you would. You heard what he said. We can't turn him over to the company."
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"That's not our call to make. That's Mikhail's call. I'm gonna check the computer and see if I can trace the doc's location. This'll take some time. Look around, see if you can find anything useful."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, what's up? Derailed? Was anyone hurt?"
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Jill?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Ah, shit... Wait what!? Jill? Jill, what happened!? Jill come in! T, I gotta go."
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Do what you gotta. I'll take care of Bard.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Am I the only one who made it? Carlos, come in. Carlos? Dammit, guess I'm out of range."
Jill,Female,Playable,That fucker's still alive. I can't stay here.
Jill,Female,Playable,Bitch can't even swim.
Jill,Female,Playable,Carlos! Respond!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Yeah. What's up?
Jill,Female,Playable,We didn't make it. The train derailed.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Derailed? Was anyone hurt?
Jill,Female,Playable,Everybody's dead. Mikhail. Everybody.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Shit...
Jill,Female,Playable,Nicholai left us to die.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Wait, what!?"
Jill,Female,Playable,What the fuck!?
Jill,Female,Playable,It's back!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Jill? Jill, what happened!? Jill! Come in!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Oh, come on!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"I'm gonna kill you! Alright, let's do this. Suck it!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Carlos!? You still there!? Oh, come on. You're gonna crap out on me NOW? God damn it!"
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,"Interesting... You've done me a big favor, Miss Valentine."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey! Answer me! God damn it! Tyrell, do you copy?"
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) What's going on?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill's been infected, I... I'm taking her to the hospital. Maybe Dr. Bard can save her!"
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Alright, I'll meet you there."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"You hang in there, supercop. I got ya."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Fight it, Jill. I'm gonna get you that vaccine. You're gonna be OK, I promise."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Tyrell, where's Bard now?"
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Gotta be the lab in the back. Stay frosty. I'm on my way.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Copy. I'll go on ahead.
Computer,,Non-Playable,Welcome to the office of Dr. Nathaniel Bard. Please state your business clearly into the intercom.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Dr. Bard, are you in there? I'm here to rescue you! Open the door!"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"OK, not this way…"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Jesus Christ!
Nurse,,Non-Playable,All I wanted to know was what the documents were doing in your office in the first place—
Dr. Bard,Male,Non-Playable,"Who do you think you're talking to? I'm goddam Nathaniel Bard! I'm the best biologist you'll ever meet, you bedpan-changing waste of a nursing degree. Of course I have connections higher up. Of course the military consults with me on projects beyond your comprehension. So stop wasting my time with your nosy questions!"
Nurse,,Non-Playable,"...I-I'm sorry, Doctor."
Dr. Bard,Male,Non-Playable,"...You didn't read the documents, did you?"
Nurse,,Non-Playable,"No, I shredded them just like you asked."
Dr. Bard,Male,Non-Playable,"Good... Good. If that's all, you can go back to wiping your patients' asses. That's what they pay you for, right? And polish my shoes."
Nurse,,Non-Playable,"Yes, sir."
Dr. Bard,Male,Non-Playable,"I bet you know a lot about polishing, don't you? Now fuck off. And don't say a word to anyone."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Bard. (via radio) Tyrell! Bard's dead. He's been shot!
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Shit. And the vaccine?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,I'm looking.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Well, look harder! There's gotta be a computer, right?"
Dr. Bard,Male,Non-Playable,"This is VRC Chief Nathaniel Bard. September 29... 11 p.m. I am acutely aware... that my time's running out. And I hope and pray by making this recording and bringing the truth to light... that I can restore some small shred of honor to my name. All of Raccoon City's suffering began with the release of a biological weapon known as the T-Virus. My employer, the Umbrella Corporation, engineered this virus... and they ordered my team to develop a vaccine, which we did. Now I keep samples of this vaccine here in my office, The rest of it is stored underground. But those sons of bitches on the board... they want to destroy it. They don't want the world to know what they've done... so they're trying to erase all evidence that the virus ever existed. Now I'm not a fool. I know they don't want me to—"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"My god, Jill knew all along. And she trusted me anyway."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Is it here?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Alright, Jill. Hang tight. T, I got it!"
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Good. I'm headed your way.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Be careful.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Careful? (laughs) Have you seen this town? It'll be a fucking miracle if I get there in one piece.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"You're gonna be OK, Jill."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Come on... This shit better work.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Jesus. Tyrell. What the hell happened!?
Reporter,,Non-Playable,"Attention all citizens. The contagion spreading throughout the city has been designated uncontainable. On October 1, Raccoon City will be completely destroyed in a missile strike. All residents capable of rational thought are urged to evacuate immediately. This is not a test. Attention all citizens... (the recording continues)"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Man, that's only a day away. There's still people in the city!"
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,You think Uncle Sam gives a shit? Fuck. Here they come.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Now you sit tight. I got this.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"Better grab some gear. Sounds like there's a lot of 'em out there... (via radio) I'm gonna try to lower the window shutters! The less entry points, the better!"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,And how do we do that?
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) I'll try hacking into the hospital security system. Keep 'em off me in the meantime!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"OK, now the fun shit begins."
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Carlos, they've breached the room!"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Aw, c'mon."
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Find the breaker! It must be somewhere!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Almost got it! There. Now I just gotta clean up.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"(via radio) Carlos, maybe you can knock the pillar down with that explosive!"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,I'm on it!
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,(via radio) Carlos! You alright?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Not even close. But at least it's over. I'm comin' back.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Vaccine's the real deal.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Good.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,You goin' somewhere?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,You're damn right.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,What do you think you're gonna do? The whole city's about to be microwaved.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"C'mon, man. Call the government. Tell them we found a cure. You stall for time!"
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Ballsy motherfucker.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill! Oh, thank god! You're OK. I've got good news. It's over now. The city's safe."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"(barely speaking) Shoot me, Jill!"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,It's the only way…
Jill,Female,Playable,Where am I? What's going on?
Jill,Female,Playable,"October 1st? No, it can't be."
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Morning sunshine.
Jill,Female,Playable,You saved my life.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,I sure as shit didn't. That was all Carlos. He carried you here and he treated you himself crazy bastard.
Jill,Female,Playable,Where is he?
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"He went underground. Bard stockpiled the vaccine, enough to give the city some hope."
Jill,Female,Playable,He thinks he can do this by himself. I'm going after him.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"Wait! Did you see the broadcast? They’re gonna blow the city sky high. I'm trying to get ahold of someone, anyone with the clearance to stop it. Leave this mess to him. He's a professional."
Jill,Female,Playable,So am I.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"Right. Guess I'm not talkin' you out of this. The storage facility is underground, beneath this hospital. I've lost contact with Carlos, so expect trouble."
Jill,Female,Playable,(looking at his body) This looks like Nicholai’s work.
Jill,Female,Playable,This must be the way underground.
Jill,Female,Playable,How is it no one in the hospital ever noticed all this?
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,"(via loudspeaker) I must admit, I respect your tenacity. But I'm afraid our games end here."
Jill,Female,Playable,(to herself) You think this is over?
Jill,Female,Playable,"A dead end… No, wait."
Jill,Female,Playable,Shit. He got away. What was he doing in here?
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Jill!
Jill,Female,Playable,Tyrell!
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,I got through! They're willing to negotiate—
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"They'll call off the strike, if—and this is one big-ass if… we can deliver the vaccine to them before they launch."
Jill,Female,Playable,How long do we have?
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,"Hours, maybe."
Jill,Female,Playable,Then let's not waste one more second.
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,This way.
Jill,Female,Playable,Sure you don't need to stop?
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Stop and do what? I got your back.
Jill,Female,Playable,Alright. Let's get this done.
Jill,Female,Playable,Tyrell!
Jill,Female,Playable,Now! Keep going! We're almost there!
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Jill!
Jill,Female,Playable,No…
Tyrell,Male,Non-Playable,Go! GO!
Jill,Female,Playable,Shit!
Computer,,Non-Playable,"To begin vaccine synthesis, place the materials in the chamber."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Synthesis? I have to make it myself? Alright, gotta figure this out."
Computer,,Non-Playable,Override key successfully generated.
Jill,Female,Playable,What have we here?
Computer,,Non-Playable,Override key removed.
Computer,,Non-Playable,Override complete.
Jill,Female,Playable,An antigen sample. I'll definitely need this for the vaccine.
Jill,Female,Playable,This must be what powers it.
Jill,Female,Playable,Out of the way!
Jill,Female,Playable,So it's called the Nemesis.
Computer,,Non-Playable,Synthesizing vaccine... Synthesis complete. Please remove the vaccine canister.
Jill,Female,Playable,What in god's name is this place?
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,Ooh. What do we have here?
Jill,Female,Playable,"Nicholai, don't! The city needs that vaccine!"
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,"More than I do? Hmm. (he steps on Jill’s hand) I don't think the wisdom I've been trying to impart on you is getting through. Now I know you can't put a price on life. But I'm in this business to get paid. So let's make a deal. You go down there, battle the Nemesis. And if record it all and sell the combat data. Put on a good show and maybe I don't need the vaccine. Agreed? Good."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill, is that you?"
Jill,Female,Playable,Carlos!?
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,You're OK! Let me spot for you!
Jill,Female,Playable,Good idea.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Watch it! You've got company! He's hiding behind tank eight! Number eight! Here come some more! Look out! He's hiding behind tank two! Now! Rip that fucker apart! Got some more incoming! Number two! Yeah! Here come some more! Look out! Got some more incoming! Number one! Here come some more! Look out! Got some more incoming! Number five! I got this! Not what I intended to hit, but I'll take it! Here come some more! Look out! Got some more incoming! Number seven! Here come some more! Look out!"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Jill! Here comes the crane. Use it to climb up!
Jill,Female,Playable,"Oh no! C'mon, c'mon…"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill, stay back!"
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Now! Get on! I'm gonna melt this fucker into mush.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,"OK, I'll meet you up ahead!"
Jill,Female,Playable,Nicholai. Where did you go...? I have to get that vaccine back.
Jill,Female,Playable,"It's done. Give me the vaccine, you greedy son of a bitch."
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,Oh no no no no. You print money. I like money. We shall make ours an ongoing arrangement Now drop the gun!
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,"Have you—Have you ever seen anything so incredible? The data on this would be worth millions! But, uh, you know how it is—city's about to explode... And you can't put a price on life. Good luck!"
Jill,Female,Playable,Nicholai!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Jill!
Jill,Female,Playable,Go after Nicholai! He's got the vaccine!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,What about you?
Jill,Female,Playable,We're running out of time! I've got this.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,I know you do.
Jill,Female,Playable,"(to Nemesis) Look, Just so you know? This is the last fucking time."
Computer,,Non-Playable,Opening compartment.
Jill,Female,Playable,Now we're talking!
Computer,,Non-Playable,Cooldown in progress. Please reactivate power sources.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Damn, it needs power! Felt that, did you? How about some more! Go ahead! I'm gonna put you right back on your ass! You think I don't know how to fuck you up!?"
Computer,,Non-Playable,All power sources activated. Powering up.
Jill,Female,Playable,I am sick of your SHIT!
Jill,Female,Playable,Come on! Next time… take the fucking hint.
Jill,Female,Playable,Good riddance.
Jill,Female,Playable,Can't let Nicholai get away with that vaccine! I hope Carlos managed to stop him. I can still catch him.
Jill,Female,Playable,Oh no…
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,"You're not going to stop me. Promised you this, didn't I?"
Jill,Female,Playable,No! Do you have any idea what you've just done?
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,Don't know. Don't care. My client ordered me to reduce Umbrella to rubble.
Computer,,Non-Playable,Ten minutes until missile impact.
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,"Ah. The missile has launched. And that is my cue to leave. Good-bye, Miss Valentine. A shame you didn't listen to me when you had the chance."
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Jill! Shoot him!
Jill,Female,Playable,I can't! I'll hit you!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Do it! You have to! There's no other way!
Jill,Female,Playable,Carlos!
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Hey. I told you I couldn't leave you in a Carlos-less world. That would just be too cruel. What about him?
Jill,Female,Playable,Why'd you do it?
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,There's a price tag for everything. Even letting the world burn.
Jill,Female,Playable,Who are you working for?
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,I'll tell you if you get me out of here. I'll pay you whatever you want.
Nicholai,Male,Non-Playable,"You're a fool. You're a fool! If I die, you'll never find out the truth."
Jill,Female,Playable,I don't mind a little detective work.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,Jill. You alright?
Jill,Female,Playable,There it is.
Carlos,Male,Non-Playable,It's finally over.
Jill,Female,Playable,"So long, RC."
