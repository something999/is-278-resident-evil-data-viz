Chris,Male,Playable,"Alpha Team is flying around the forest zone, situated in northwest Raccoon City, where we're searching for the helicopter of our compatriots Bravo Team, who disappeared during the middle of our mission. [Background Talk: Wesker: Chris, you haven't found it? Chris: No, I haven't found it yet.]"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Bizarre murder cases have recently occured in Raccoon City. There are outlandish reports of families being attacked by a group of about 10 people. Victims were apparently eaten. Bravo Team went to the hideout of the group, and disappeared."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Look, Chris!"
Chris,Male,Playable,"It was Bravo Team's helicopter. Nobody was in it. But strangely, most of the equipment was still there. However, we soon discovered why."
Joseph,Male,Non-Playable,Hey! Come here!
Jill,Female,Playable,Joseph!
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Hwuh! Waah!
Chris,Male,Playable,No! Don't go!
Chris,Male,Playable,Jill! Run for that house!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,What is this?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Wow, what a mansion!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Captain Wesker, where's Chris?"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Stop it! Don't open that door!
Jill,Female,Playable,But Chris is--
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,What is it?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Maybe it's... Chris... (pauses) Now, Jill--Can you go?"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"I'm going with you. Chris is our old partner, ya know."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Okay. Let me handle this.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Stay alert!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,A dining room...
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,What? What is this?
Jill,Female,Playable,What is it?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Blood. (pauses) Jill, see if you can find any other clues. I'll be examining this. (looks down) Hope this is not Chris's blood..."
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,What is it?
Jill,Female,Playable,Watch out! It's a monster! (begins to back away from the approaching zombie)
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Let me take care of this.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,What IS it?
Jill,Female,Playable,"Kenneth was killed too; maybe by this creature... (pause) Anyway, let's report this to Wesker."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Investigate if you hear any gunfire.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Lost courage already? It's not like you... (returns to crouching)
Jill,Female,Playable,Who is it?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, you, stop! (pauses as the zombie gets closer to Jill) Run, Jill! He's insane!"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,What the hell?
Jill,Female,Playable,Let's report this to Wesker!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Wesker! (pause) Help me look for him, Jill. And don't leave this hall for the time being."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Find anything, Jill?"
Jill,Female,Playable,(shaking her head) Nothing. What is this all about? I can't figure it out at all.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Beats me, too."
Jill,Female,Playable,Now it's Wesker's time to disappear! I don't know what's going on.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Well, it can't be helped. Let's search for him seperately. (Jill nods) I'll check the dining room again."
Jill,Female,Playable,Okay. I'll try the door on the opposite side.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"This mansion is gigantic. We could get into trouble if we get lost. We should start from the first floor, okay? And... Jill, here is a lockpick. It might be handy if you, the master of unlocking, take it with you. (Jill nods)"
Jill,Female,Playable,Thanks. Maybe I'll need it.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Listen, if something happens, let's meet up in this hall."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"This time, I'll be there."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Hey, what's going on?"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill? Is that you, Jill? What happened?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"(frightened) Barry? Help me, please. The door won't open! (pause) Quick!"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Stay away from the door, Jill. I'm gonna kick this door down!"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Hurry! This way!
Jill,Female,Playable,"Oh, Barry!"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,That was too close. You were almost a Jill sandwich.
Jill,Female,Playable,"(giggles) You're right! Barry, thanks for saving my life. (pause) But, Barry, didn't you say you were going back to the dining room to do some research? Why on earth are you here?"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Uh, I just had something I wanted to check. Now, let's get back to searching for the lost captain and Chris, shall we?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Thank you, Barry."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, yeah..."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Jill! (nervous chuckle) Don't scare me.
Jill,Female,Playable,"That's what I was going to say. Aren't you supposed to be going over the first floor, Barry?"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, you're right. But just take a look at THIS!"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,It's Forest. Oh my God...
Jill,Female,Playable,(turns away) It's awful!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"I'm going to find out what caused Forest's death. (kneels) It looks like he was killed by a crow, or something... Can you look around the first floor, Jill?"
Jill,Female,Playable,(pauses) Okay.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, Jill... This must've been Forest's. You don't have a weapon; take this with you."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,I can't believe...
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Jill! What's going on? Any clues?
Jill,Female,Playable,"No, but something's wrong with this house."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Whoah! This hall is dangerous. Maybe it's better to secure our escape route first. There must be a back door somewhere... Let's try to find *it* first, shall we?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"(nods) Okay, let's separate again. (turns)"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Just a moment! I've found something.
Jill,Female,Playable,What is it?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"It's a weapon; it's really powerful, especially against living things. Better take it with you."
Jill,Female,Playable,"But how about you, Barry?"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,(raises his Colt Python) I have THIS!
Jill,Female,Playable,Thank you. I'll take this then. (walks over and collects the Acid Rounds)
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Jill! What's going on? Any clues?
Jill,Female,Playable,"No, but something's wrong with this house."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Whoah! This hall is dangerous. Maybe it's better to secure our escape route first. There must be a back door somewhere... Let's try to find *it* first, shall we?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"(nods) Okay, let's separate again. (turns)"

Jill,Female,Playable,What is it?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"It's a weapon; it's really powerful, especially against living things. Better take it with you."
Jill,Female,Playable,"But how about you, Barry?"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,(raises his Colt Python) I have THIS!
Jill,Female,Playable,Thank you. I'll take this then. (walks over and collects the Acid Rounds)
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Is that you, Jill?"
Jill,Female,Playable,What's going on? How come you look so scared?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Look at this. (holds out his hand)
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,What do you think of it?
Jill,Female,Playable,I've been thinking something is wrong with this house.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Right.
Jill,Female,Playable,Hey... What is this? There's a page missing.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, I thought about that too. Perhaps that was the most important part."
Jill,Female,Playable,Richard! What happened? (kneels down by Richard's side)
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,Oh Jill... This house... is... dangerous... There are... terrible demons... Ouch!
Jill,Female,Playable,You're wounded! What kind of demon attacked you?
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,It was a huge... snake... and also... poisonous. Ugh...
Jill,Female,Playable,"Poisonous? Oh no... Richard, hold on!"
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,"There is Serum... (pause) Oh no, I should've brought some with me."
Jill,Female,Playable,No problem. I'll go and get it.
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,Thanks.
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,Be careful... (Jill nods.)
Jill,Female,Playable,"Here's the Serum. Richard, hold on! I'll give you a shot now."
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill, here's... my radio... you should... keep it... I'm..."
Jill,Female,Playable,No! Richard!
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,Jill... be careful... Uhh... Uh...
Jill,Female,Playable,(weakly) Am I poisoned? Give me the Serum...
Jill,Female,Playable,Am I poisoned? Give me the Serum...
Jill,Female,Playable,(yawns) (sleepily) Barry..? (awake) Barry?
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,"This is Brad. STARS Alpha Team, please respond! What the hell? Is nobody out there?"
Jill,Female,Playable,(into radio) Brad. This is Jill.
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,This is Brad... STARS Alpha Team... Bravo Team... It doesn' matter. Anybody... Answer me... This is Brad(fades out)
Jill,Female,Playable,Brad? Brad?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,It can't be true! I've been told a different story.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,But it's not necessary for you to destroy STARS!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,What about my family?!?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,So everything depends on me... Huh?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,It can't be true! I've been told a different story.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, there is nothing we can do. The situation has changed."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,But it's not necessary for you to destroy STARS!
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,It's not my intention! It's Umbrella's. I can't help it.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,What about my family?!?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,I will guarantee their safety.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,So everything depends on me... Huh?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Hi, Jill."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Uh, hi, Barry. I, I heard someone talking."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,So you heard it too... I think I'm getting old. It seems that talking to myself is becoming a habit.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Talking to yourself? Barry, something must have happened to you. Am I wrong? You sound strange."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Well, it seems I made you worry. But don't. Maybe I have been a nervous wreck since all of these strange things started happening. Well, I think I'll go out and get some fresh air for a change."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"I told ya, don't worry... I'll just go and get some fresh air... and be eaten by a monster!"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,What the hell is this?
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Jill!
Jill,Female,Playable,You saved me!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Yeah...
Jill,Female,Playable,"That was close! Thanks, Barry."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Don't mention it. What a monster! I can't believe--What the hell is this place, anyway?"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Okay, I'm gonna stay in the Soldier's Area and take a look around. Though I'm sure there are still things in that other mansion as well. Anyway, let's start searching seperately."
Jill,Female,Playable,Okay.
Jill,Female,Playable,Wesker!
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Jill... so you're safe.
Jill,Female,Playable,That's what I was going to say. Where on earth have you been? You disappeared from the hall all of a sudden.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"I'm sorry, but I have my reasons. Perhaps you guys have met them? It was all I could do to protect myself against those... strange creatures."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Is that right? Anyway, it's good to see you're safe."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill, our first priority is to get out of here."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Yes, you're right."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Now there are a lot of rooms in that mansion that we can't get into because they're locked up. I have been looking around for clues...
Jill,Female,Playable,"Okay, I'll go to the other house and see if I can find any clues."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Will you do that? I'm counting on you.
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,"This is Brad. I know you can't answer me, but somehow, give me a sign."
Jill,Female,Playable,(into radio) This is Jill. Brad? (angry moan) It's broken...
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill, have you found anything interesting?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Yes, but I can't see very well."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,How about going down to check by yourself? I have a rope here.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Oh, do you? Well then I'll try to go down using the rope."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Wait.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Hey, what's going on?"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Now I've done it! Sorry, Jill, wait. I'll go and get another rope."
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry? Barry!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, are you there, Jill? Grab the rope!"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"I'm sorry, Jill."
Jill,Female,Playable,I didn't know THAT was going to happen.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Sorry. I was really careless.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Are you okay, Barry? Maybe you're getting tired."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"No, I'm alright. Don't worry. (pause) Jill, I've found something!"
Jill,Female,Playable,Thank you. I'll take this then.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill, have you found anything interesting?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Yes, but I can't see very well."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,How about going down to check by yourself? I have a rope here.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Oh, do you? Well then I'll try to go down using the rope."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Wait.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, Richard gave this to me. The radio is a keepsake from him."
Jill,Female,Playable,Richard... *(She takes the Radio.)*
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"This is more useful to you than me. Ready to go? *(Jill nods. Then Jill climbs down. But once she is down, the rope falls!)*"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Hey, what's going on?"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Now I've done it! Sorry, Jill, wait. I'll go and get another rope."
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry? Barry!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, are you there, Jill? Grab the rope!"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"I'm sorry, Jill."
Jill,Female,Playable,I didn't know THAT was going to happen.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Sorry. I was really careless.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Are you okay, Barry? Maybe you're getting tired."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"No, I'm alright. Don't worry. (pause) Jill, I've found something!"
Jill,Female,Playable,Thank you. I'll take this then.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, Jill. What good timing. A moment ago I heard someone's voice coming from this hall. Let's go together, since it's dark, and we can't see very well."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Okay, let's go."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Okay. Then I'm gonna cover you. Let's hurry! *(Jill looks down.)* Hey, are you alright? I can go first if you want me to."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Oh, yes, please. I'm a little nervous."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"I understand. It may be more dangerous if you come behind me. Be careful! *(Barry walks off. As Jill walks forward to follow him, a gunshot is heard.)*"
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,That was too close. Let's go together.
Jill,Female,Playable,"(nods) Okay, let's go!"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Okay, then I'm gonna cover you. Let's hurry! *(They continue. Scene ends.)*"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Okay, let's go."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Okay. Then I'm gonna cover you. Let's hurry! *(Jill looks down.)* Hey, are you alright? I can go first if you want me to."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Okay, let's go, Barry. I'm depending on you."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Barry, I..."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Sure, it may be dangerous. I'll go, even if I have to go by myself. Will you be waiting here, Jill?"
Jill,Female,Playable,I'm sorry.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,It's okay. I'm going now. *(Barry salutes her and walks off. Jill won't see him again until the Wesker confrontation in the lab. Barry dies afterwards.)*
Jill,Female,Playable,"Barry, I..."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Sure, it may be dangerous. I'll go, even if I have to go by myself. Will you be waiting here, Jill?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Barry, I think I'll take some other route."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"I see. Yeah, maybe you should. Be careful! *(Barry salutes her and walks off. As Jill walks forward, a gunshot is heard.)*"
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry?
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,Is that Jill?
Jill,Female,Playable,Is that voice Enrico's?
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,Yeah.
Jill,Female,Playable,You're alive!
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,"(interrupting) Wait there! Are you with anybody, Jill?"
Jill,Female,Playable,What? Oh yes. *(Barry walks over.)*
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Enrico! *(He walks closer to join Jill.)*
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,"So, Barry and Jill together."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Are you alright, Enrico?"
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,The S.T.A.R.S. are doomed. Someone is a traitor. (The camera zooms in on Enrico) Everything was plotted from the start by Umbrella...
Jill,Female,Playable,Enrico!!
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,Is that Jill?
Jill,Female,Playable,Is that voice Enrico's?
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,Yeah.
Jill,Female,Playable,You're alive!
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,"(interrupting) Wait there! Are you with anybody, Jill?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Wha, What? Oh, no; I'm alone. But why are you asking?"
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,"Listen, the S.T.A.R.S. are going to be finished soon. Someone is a traitor. (Camera closeup on Enrico) Everything was plotted from the start by Umbrella..."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Enrico! Who killed him, I wonder?"
Jill,Female,Playable,What happened?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Uhh... I'm really... embarrassed... I was... clumsy...
Jill,Female,Playable,"Oh, you don't have to talk. I'm going to give you first aid!"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Maybe... my time's come... Jill... take this... I've been cheating... you all... from the start... If you can... forgive me... Would you... please give this to my family... (Jill nods) And if you can... please... try... to protect them...
Jill,Female,Playable,"What do you mean by that, Barry? Don't give up!"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Uhh... Jill... be careful of that guy... (gasps) Please... stay alive... (convulses, gives his last sigh, and dies)"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Jill? Is that you, Jill?"
Jill,Female,Playable,Oh Chris! You're alive!
Chris,Male,Playable,"(walks over to the cell door window) Of course. Dammit, we're in quite a predicament, Jill."
Jill,Female,Playable,"I know, Chris. Anyway, I have to open this room. *(She bangs on the handle twice, and moans.)* It doesn't work! Well, Chris, I'll be sure to come back and help you soon. Will you wait here?"
Chris,Male,Playable,Thanks! I'll be waiting here for you.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Jill!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Jill, you're here too?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Yes, you're here too?"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Look, uh, I lost my way."
Jill,Female,Playable,Let's get going!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Jill!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,I was looking for you.
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry...
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Jill... Don't be angry. I wanted you to wait for me.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Barry, don't screw up again like you did when you dropped that rope."
Jill,Female,Playable,Wesker?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"You did a fine job, Barry."
Jill,Female,Playable,Just as I thought...
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"I think you should stay away from Barry, Jill. I hear that his wife and two daughters will be in danger if he doesn't do everything I tell him to."
Jill,Female,Playable,You are so cruel...
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Well, you don't have to worry about anything, because you'll be free from this world very soon, Jill."
Jill,Female,Playable,Why do you have to destroy S.T.A.R.S?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"That's Umbrella's intention. This laboratory has been engaging in dangerous experiments, and recently an accident has occurred. Anyway, this disaster cannot be made public."
Jill,Female,Playable,"That's why having S.T.A.R.S. nosing about is so inconvenient. So you're a slave of Umbrella now, along with these virus monsters."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"I think you misunderstand me, Jill. To me, the monsters you mention mean nothing. I'm going to burn all of them together, with this entire laboratory. I must complete my mission, as ordered by Umbrella. Barry, go up on the ground and wait there."
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry!
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Barry's such a fool. He'll be under the control of Umbrella forever.
Jill,Female,Playable,"How come both Umbrella and you can intimidate him, by taking his family as hostages?"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Umbrella? Well, I intimidated him, but it had nothing to do with Umbrella. I just used him for my personal purposes, though both you and Barry seemed to think I was following orders from Umbrella."
Jill,Female,Playable,So you're planning something else?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"If you succeeded in developing the world's most powerful biological weapon, what would you do? What if you were in charge?"
Jill,Female,Playable,You must stop this now.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"You're a brave girl. But if I were you, I wouldn't give up such a big discovery. You guys are idiots. No one understands its real value."
Jill,Female,Playable,"So, you're going to steal all the research?"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Better yet. I'm going to show you the Tyrant.
Jill,Female,Playable,Wesker?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"You did a fine job, Barry."
Jill,Female,Playable,Just as I thought...
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"I think you should stay away from Barry, Jill. I hear that his wife and two daughters will be in danger if he doesn't do everything I tell him to."
Jill,Female,Playable,You are so cruel...

Jill,Female,Playable,Barry!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Sorry, Jill."
Jill,Female,Playable,How is your family?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Uh, I was listening to what you and Wesker were talking about. I wish I'd realized it earlier. I thought it must have something to do with Umbrella, ya know... (pause) So it's all been masterminded by him!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"But it's good that you know that now. Anyway, let's get out of this house first."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Jill!
Jill,Female,Playable,"Yes, what?"
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Do you have any idea what Wesker was going to show you, at the back of this place?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Well, he was talking about the world's most powerful biological weapon, called Tyrant, or something, I-I think."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Do you think we could see Tyrant now?
Jill,Female,Playable,"Barry, you're so optimistic."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,(raising his weapon) It would look bad for S.T.A.R.S. if we let such a dangerous creature run loose...
Jill,Female,Playable,Maybe you're right. Let's go then.
Jill,Female,Playable,Wesker?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Barry is no longer useful.
Jill,Female,Playable,Just as I thought. You are the man behind all of this.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Hah hah heh heh.
Jill,Female,Playable,Why do you have to destroy S.T.A.R.S?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,That's Umbrella's intention. This laboratory has

Jill,Female,Playable,"So, you're going to steal all the research?"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Better yet. I'm going to show you the Tyrant.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Tyrant virus is a super virus; which creates a monster which is much stronger than human beings. Tyrant is the most powerful biological weapon in the world.
Jill,Female,Playable,You don't mean you're experimenting on... real people?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,This is really beautiful. All this power will be mine...
Jill,Female,Playable,For the sake of an awful creature?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Don't be upset. All weak people exist to be eaten.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"What? Don't come this way! (He reaches for the control panel, but is skewered by the Tyrant's huge claw.) No!!!!"
Jill,Female,Playable,It can't control what it does.
Jill,Female,Playable,Can a creature like this really be the ultimate biological weapon?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Really. Wesker is a crazy man!
Jill,Female,Playable,Tyrant is not completely developed.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,But we can't let it live! (looks at the panel) That must be the computer for monitoring this creature!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Damn you!
Jill,Female,Playable,(as the Tyrant looks at her) It can't control what it does.
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry? Barry!
Jill,Female,Playable,You're alive!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,I'm really... embarrassed... I was... clumsy.
Jill,Female,Playable,Let's get going.
Jill,Female,Playable,What happened to Wesker?
Voice,,Non-Playable,The Triggering System has now been activated. All researchers stand by to take cover immediately... Unlock all routes for evacuation...
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Wesker must've set it off... There isn't much time left for us...
Chris,Male,Playable,"Oh, Jill! (runs up to Jill)"
Jill,Female,Playable,Sorry for keeping you waiting!
Chris,Male,Playable,"So, everything is done?"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Well, almost, yes. Now let's go!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Oh Jill!
Jill,Female,Playable,Oh Chris! So you're okay!
Chris,Male,Playable,Yeah! You too! What happened to Wesker?
Jill,Female,Playable,Let's talk about it later. Let's get out of here!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Hi... Jill... It's you...
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,I'm... really embarrassed... to see you now. Just... just leave me. Go... go quickly.
Jill,Female,Playable,"It's over, Barry. Wesker's dead."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Is that so? (pause) Jill, will you do me a favor? This is my last... wish. Please... give... this photo to my... family... Will you?"
Jill,Female,Playable,Sure.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Forgive me... Jill...
Chris,Male,Playable,Jill!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Hi... Jill... It's you...
Jill,Female,Playable,Barry?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,I'm... really embarrassed... to see you now. Just... just leave me. Go... go quickly.
Jill,Female,Playable,"It's over, Barry. Wesker's dead."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Is that so? (pause) Jill, will you do me a favor? This is my last... wish. Please... give... this photo to my... family... Will you?"
Jill,Female,Playable,Sure.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Forgive me... Jill...
Chris,Male,Playable,My God!
Jill,Female,Playable,"Let's get going, Chris. We can't stop."
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Hurry!
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,Hurry!
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,"This is Brad... Running out of fuel... If there is anyone alive, contact me now, okay? This is the last time... (fades out)"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Oh no, you must be kidding! After we've come all the way here!"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Ladies first! Go first, Jill!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"But, Chris!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Give me a chance to play nice guy.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Okay, I leave it up to you. See you again at the heliport."
Voice,,Non-Playable,There is three minutes until explosion.
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Dammit! We have only one more step to go! Okay, I'll go. Jill, you try to contact Brad."
Jill,Female,Playable,Okay!
Voice,,Non-Playable,There is three minutes until explosion.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Oh no, you must be kidding! After we've come all the way here!"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Ladies first! Go first, Jill!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"But, Chris!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Give me a chance to play nice guy.
Jill,Female,Playable,"Okay, I leave it up to you. See you again at the heliport."
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,"It's coming! Jill, kill that monster! You're a(n) Amazon, Jill!"
Jill,Female,Playable,Your wife?
Barry,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, uh, my wife and kids. (pause) Uh, they always wait up for me... Even (uh) today (uh) my eldest daughter... (pauses, his face twists) Aw, I'm sorry..."
Jill,Female,Playable,Don't worry about that. I know he must still be alive...
Chris,Male,Playable,"Alpha Team is flying around the forest zone, situated in northwest Raccoon City, where we're searching for the helicopter of our compatriots Bravo Team, who disappeared during the middle of our mission. [Background Talk: Wesker: Chris, you haven't found it? Chris: No, I haven't found it yet.]"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Bizarre murder cases have recently occured in Raccoon City. There are outlandish reports of families being attacked by a group of about 10 people. Victims were apparently eaten. Bravo Team went to the hideout of the group, and disappeared."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Look, Chris!"
Chris,Male,Playable,"It was Bravo Team's helicopter. Nobody was in it. But strangely, most of the equipment was still there. However, we soon discovered why."
Joseph,Male,Non-Playable,Hey! Come here!
Jill,Female,Playable,Joseph!
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Hwuh! Waah!
Chris,Male,Playable,No! Don't go!
Chris,Male,Playable,Jill! Run for that house!
Chris,Male,Playable,"There are only 3 STARS members left now: Captain Wesker, Jill, and myself. We don't know where Barry is."
Jill,Female,Playable,I don't know what happened.
Chris,Male,Playable,Barry! Where's Barry?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Well, I'm sorry, but he's probably..."
Jill,Female,Playable,No...
Jill,Female,Playable,What is that?
Chris,Male,Playable,I'll go and check.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Okay, Jill and I will stay in the hall in case of an emergency."
Jill,Female,Playable,Chris... take care.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Investigate if you hear any gunfire.
Chris,Male,Playable,Wesker? Jill?
Chris,Male,Playable,What happened to Jill and Wesker?
Chris,Male,Playable,Whoah! What is it?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"What? Oh! Oh no! Sorry, I didn't mean to do that."
Chris,Male,Playable,"Heh ha, you must be from the Bravo Team."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Yes, I'm Rebecca. Rebecca Chambers. I'm a newcomer. I just joined the STARS Bravo Team last month. Well, I'm really sorry. Are you all right?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Yes. I'm Chris Redfield, from the Alpha Team. Are you the only person here from the Bravo Team?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Well, because the helicopter made a forced landing, I just ran into this house, anyway, but I, uh... uh..."
Chris,Male,Playable,"I see. There's nothing else you could've done, anyway, it's good you're here."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"(salutes) Yes, sir. But it's strange... I serviced the helicopter recently, but something went wrong with the engine. It was such a short flight..."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I wonder if everybody is...
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Well? What should I do now? If you go out to search for the other members, how about letting me come with you?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Alright, let's do it!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,(salutes) Yes sir! I'll do my best. (pause) I have to prepare something; would you like to go ahead?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Well? What should I do now? If you go out to search for the other members, how about letting me come with you?"
Chris,Male,Playable,It's pretty dangerous outside; let me take care of it.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"I understand. For now, I'll wait here, since there are a lot of chemicals in this room, and they might be useful. Well, I'll look over the chemicals."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Well, I'll look over the chemicals."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Ah, Chris! This room is fully equipped with medical supplies. I can treat you, except for your major injury. Would you like me to?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Please do something for me, temporarily."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Most of these medicines are from Umbrella.
Chris,Male,Playable,What's Umbrella?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Don't you know? It's a large-scale pharmaceutical company based in Raccoon City.
Chris,Male,Playable,"Oh, I see. And do you know how much of the medicine is useable?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Well, probably there is enough for 2 doses."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Chris, take care!"
Chris,Male,Playable,"I'm okay, but if something happens to me, (desperately) please take care of me."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Okay. You can depend on me. But we only have enough medicine for 3 more doses. Excuse me, but you aren't mad at me about all that, are you?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Oh, of course not. You were pretty worried, though, weren't you? Hey, we're partners, aren't we? Let's work together."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Yes, sir! I'll do my best!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Are you alright? Want me to treat it?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Are you alright? Want me to treat it?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,This is the last dose. Don't go doing reckless things anymore.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Who are you?
Chris,Male,Playable,"I'm Chris, of Alpha Team. I've come to rescue you. Richard, what happened?"
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,Chris... this house is too dangerous... there are terrible demons... (blood gushes up from a wound) Ouch!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Richard, don't talk. He seems to have been bitten by a poisonous snake, but the size of the wound is abnormally large."
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,"It's not just a poisonous snake, it's a monster!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Richard... He needs serum, but we left it in another room."
Chris,Male,Playable,"Okay, I'll go! (runs)"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Hurry, please!"
Chris,Male,Playable,"I will. Wait here, I'll be back soon."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Please, hurry!"
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,Be careful!
Chris,Male,Playable,Here's the Serum! Is he alright?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Yes he is; thanks. Richard, hold on, I'll give you a shot now."
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,Chris... Chris... here's a Radio... take it...
Chris,Male,Playable,Richard! No!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Richard!
Richard,Male,Non-Playable,Rebecca... be careful...
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Richard... Richard! Are you...
Chris,Male,Playable,"Rebecca, it's very dangerous out here. Will you come with me?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I... I'd like to stay here a little bit longer...
Chris,Male,Playable,"Okay, Rebecca. Can you use a gun? I'll look for the others. Protect yourself."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Chris, be careful, please!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Be careful, please!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"It's me, Chris."
Chris,Male,Playable,"Is that you, Rebecca?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Ah, it's the Moonlight Sonata."
Chris,Male,Playable,Can you play?
Chris,Male,Playable,"Wait, what is that?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"My interpretation is off a little. Chris, may I practice for a while?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"It's me, Chris."
Chris,Male,Playable,Are you all right?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Yes. I have decided not to grieve any longer.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Ah, it's the Moonlight Sonata."
Chris,Male,Playable,Can you play?
Chris,Male,Playable,"Wait, what is that?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"My interpretation is off a little. Chris, may I practice for a while?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"See, just relax and play."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Alright.
Chris,Male,Playable,Let's go back and look for them at once.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,All right.
Chris,Male,Playable,(scoldingly) Rebecca...
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"I know, I know. But just a little longer..."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Chris! Chris!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,You like it? (Chris nods)
Chris,Male,Playable,"Oh, that was great!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Wh, what is that?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Chris, be careful!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Chris, are you alright?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Am I poisoned? Dammit, get me Serum..."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Chris... Chris...
Chris,Male,Playable,"Is that you, Rebecca?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Chris, are you alright?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Uh, yeah... What happened?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,You were bitten by a poisonous snake! Are you okay?
Chris,Male,Playable,Uhh... My head is killing me...
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"I think you'll be alright, because I gave you a shot; but please, stay out of trouble!"
Chris,Male,Playable,You saved my life... I owe you one.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Chris, take care!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Chris!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Am I poisoned? Dammit, get me Serum!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I'm sure the Serum must be there! I'll be right back!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,You alright?
Chris,Male,Playable,Yeah... What happened?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,You were bitten by a poisonous snake! Are you okay?
Chris,Male,Playable,Uhh... My head is killing me...
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"I think you will be alright, because I gave you a shot; but please, be careful!"
Chris,Male,Playable,You saved my life... I owe you one.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I'm glad I could help!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Am I poisoned? Dammit, get me Serum!"
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,"This is Brad! S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team, please respond! What the hell? Is nobody out there?"
Chris,Male,Playable,(into Radio) This is Chris.
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,This is Brad... STARS Alpha Team... Bravo Team... It doesn' matter. Anybody... Answer me... This is Brad(fades out)
Chris,Male,Playable,Damn! It's broken!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Chris!
Chris,Male,Playable,Rebecca... No... It's no use. The roots of it are in the basement. You could... whoah...
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Chris!
Chris,Male,Playable,Take this file with you.
Chris,Male,Playable,"Use the information in it... in order to make the potion... and kill the root. Rebecca, please..."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Chris, don't die!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Oh! I can't believe it! Are you okay?
Chris,Male,Playable,Yeah. So much for him. We got to the root of the problem. Saved again.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I... just...
Chris,Male,Playable,"Really, thank you."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"(hesitantly) You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you?"
Chris,Male,Playable,(nods) I guarantee it.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Well, Chris, this is Richard's Radio. We received communication from Brad at the courtyard a little while ago, but he is still flying around in the sky. He obviously couldn't hear our voices. Maybe his radio is broken."
Chris,Male,Playable,I see; understood. I'll keep it. We should somehow let Brad know we're here.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"At the pharmaceutical room I found a little while ago, I think I will be able to make something..."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Anyway, Chris, I'm glad you're safe."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Oh! I can't believe it! Are you okay?
Chris,Male,Playable,Yeah. So much for him. We got to the root of the problem. Saved again.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I... just...
Chris,Male,Playable,"Really, thank you."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"(hesitantly) You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you?"
Chris,Male,Playable,(nods) I guarantee it.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Well, I think I can make another potion. I'll go back to the pharmaceutical room I found a little while ago."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Anyway, Chris, I'm glad you're safe."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"This room is fully equipped with medical supplies. I can treat you, except for your major injury. Would you like me to?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Please do something for me, temporarily."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Most of these medicines are from Umbrella.
Chris,Male,Playable,What's Umbrella?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Don't you know? It's a large-scale pharmaceutical company based in Raccoon City.
Chris,Male,Playable,"Oh, I see."
Chris,Male,Playable,"I'm okay, but if something happens to me, (desperately) please take care of me."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Most of these medicines are from Umbrella.
Chris,Male,Playable,What's Umbrella?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Don't you know? It's a large-scale pharmaceutical company, based in Raccoon City."
Chris,Male,Playable,"Oh, I see."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Chris, take care!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Are you alright? Want me to treat it?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Chris, be careful!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Wesker!
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Chris... You're alive.
Chris,Male,Playable,My words exactly. Where's Jill? Aren't you with Jill?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,I'm sorry. We were attacked by a strange monster. I lost track of her while we were scouting around. I hope she's okay...
Chris,Male,Playable,"I see. Well, it's not your fault. This place is crazy! If we stay here, all of us will end up dead! What should we do, Wesker?"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"We have to complete this mission. Whether we escape or stay and look for Jill, we don't have many bullets left, and we can't even protect ourselves. We're still in trouble. Chris, there are a lot of locked rooms in that house. Check them out one more time. There must be a place to hide safely. I'll look around the house a little more."
Chris,Male,Playable,Okay...
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Let's get going.
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,"This is Brad. I know you can't answer me, but somehow, give me a sign."
Chris,Male,Playable,"(into Radio) This is Chris! Brad, can you hear me? Damn!"
Chris,Male,Playable,What?
Chris,Male,Playable,"It must be a S.T.A.R.S. Radio! It's a little bit broken, but it might still be useable. I'll take it with me."
Chris,Male,Playable,"Wh, what are they? M, monsters? (pause) Rebecca! She's still in the house!"
Chris,Male,Playable,What are they?
Chris,Male,Playable,It's Rebecca! She must be upstairs!
Chris,Male,Playable,Rebecca!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Chris!
Chris,Male,Playable,Thank God you're safe!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I'm sorry that you were worried about me.
Chris,Male,Playable,"We are in great danger! We must organize a search for the others, and get the hell outta here! Understood?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Yes, sir!"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Okay, I'll go first. Proceed with your own judgement. All right, can you do it?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Yes, I can! (salutes)"
Chris,Male,Playable,Good luck!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Yes, sir! I'll do my best!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Rebecca!
Chris,Male,Playable,Rebecca!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Chris!
Chris,Male,Playable,Thank God you're safe!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I'm sorry that you were worried about me.
Chris,Male,Playable,"We are in great danger! We must organize a search for the others, and get the hell outta here! Understood?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Yes, sir!"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Okay, I'll go first. Proceed with your own judgement. All right, can you do it?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Yes, I can! (salutes)"
Chris,Male,Playable,Good luck!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Yes, sir! I'll do my best!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Rebecca!
Chris,Male,Playable,REBECCA!!!!
Chris,Male,Playable,Enrico!
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,"Don't come any closer, Chris."
Chris,Male,Playable,"Wait, what happened?"
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,Double-crosser!
Chris,Male,Playable,Don't!
Enrico,Male,Non-Playable,Hell... Umbrella...
Chris,Male,Playable,Who is it? Is someone there?
Chris,Male,Playable,Double-crosser? What did he mean by that?
Jill,Female,Playable,Chris!
Chris,Male,Playable,Jill!
Jill,Female,Playable,"Chris, Wesker, he is..."
Chris,Male,Playable,I know.
Chris,Male,Playable,"Shoot, it doesn't open! Look, Jill; wait here, I'll save you."
Jill,Female,Playable,"Okay, I'll wait."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Chris!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Rebecca, you're safe!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I saw you in the garden. I've caught up with you at last!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Well, I'm glad you're all right. Don't go out alone!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"(salutes) Yes, sir!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Chris!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Rebecca, you're safe!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I'm sorry.
Chris,Male,Playable,"Well, I'm glad you're all right. Don't go out alone!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"(salutes) Yes, sir!"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Chris, as my subordinate, you have wonderful talent."
Chris,Male,Playable,"I would never work for a company like Umbrella... And Wesker, you were formally with Umbrella."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,What do you mean?
Chris,Male,Playable,"Since when have you been an Umbrella agent, and a traitor to the S.T.A.R.S.?"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Now you're wrong! I was formally with Umbrella, yes; but now I'm prepared to face anything, even getting rid of you vigilante S.T.A.R.S.!"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Now the worst possible situation has occured. The failure of the experiment created a virus; a biological weapon, polluting the entire lab!"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"No, the worst happened with the Tyrant Virus; I lost some of my S.T.A.R.S. team members because of it."
Chris,Male,Playable,You killed them with your own hands! Did you kill Enrico?
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Really?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Yeah. Like this...
Chris,Male,Playable,Rebecca!
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Don't move! If you do, I'll kill you. Chris, I have something to show you. Now, walk."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Chris, as my subordinate, you have wonderful talent."
Chris,Male,Playable,"I would never work for a company like Umbrella... And Wesker, you were formally with Umbrella."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,What do you mean?
Chris,Male,Playable,"Since when have you been an Umbrella agent, and a traitor to the S.T.A.R.S.?"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Now you're wrong! I was formally with Umbrella, yes; but now I'm prepared to face anything, even getting rid of you vigilante S.T.A.R.S.!"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Now the worst possible situation has occured. The failure of the experiment created a virus; a biological weapon, polluting the entire lab!"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"No, the worst happened with the Tyrant Virus; I lost some of my S.T.A.R.S. team members because of it."
Chris,Male,Playable,You killed them with your own hands! Did you kill Enrico?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Enrico? I'll destroy the S.T.A.R.S. myself, including you. The fact is, Umbrella does not know what to do with the Tyrant Virus. We have orders to blow up this laboratory, and it's not a bad idea. But I think we should save this important research... for future use."
Chris,Male,Playable,"You, you think you can disappear with such important material?"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"Would you like to see it? Come with me... Sorry for my lack of manners, but I'm not used to escorting men. Now, walk."
Chris,Male,Playable,Is this...?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,"That's right; this is the ultimate lifeform, Tyrant!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Ho ho ho ha ha ha...
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Chris?
Chris,Male,Playable,Hahahahahahahahahaha....
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Stop it!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Wesker, you're pitiful. This is your savior? You say this failure is your savior?"
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,You can make sure yourself whether Tyrant is a failure or not.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Go to hell. Jill will join you too.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,What? Don't come this way!
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,No!!!
Chris,Male,Playable,You can't kill me!
Chris,Male,Playable,Wow!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Hah, it seems like this bullet-proof jacket is pretty strong!"
Chris,Male,Playable,I see!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,How about Captain Wesker?
Chris,Male,Playable,"He's sleeping with the ultimate failure. Hurry up, I wanna get outta here!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Excuse me, Chris..."
Chris,Male,Playable,"What, Rebecca?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I saw a research file in this lab. It said that a great deal of research on the Tyrant Virus exists right here! We should blow this place up!
Chris,Male,Playable,"We're already into it over our heads. Rebecca, can you do it?"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Yes sir! I'll set off a triggering system for a bomb!
Chris,Male,Playable,Okay! Now we have a chance to escape! See you outside the house!
Voice,,Non-Playable,The Triggering System has now been activated. All researchers stand by to take cover immediately. Unlock all routes for evacuation.
Chris,Male,Playable,Jill! Sorry for making you wait.
Jill,Female,Playable,Chris!
Jill,Female,Playable,I knew I could trust you.
Chris,Male,Playable,Let's go! There's no need to stay.
Chris,Male,Playable,Jill! Are you there?
Jill,Female,Playable,Chris?
Chris,Male,Playable,"Jill, you're all right!"
Jill,Female,Playable,"Ahh, yes. Wesker is here... he's--"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Oh, I know. Anyway, let's get outta here!"
Brad,Male,Non-Playable,"This is Brad... I have a fuel shortage... Okay, this is the last try... If somebody's alive, please, send a sign... This... (fades out)"
Jill,Female,Playable,Let me take care of them!
Chris,Male,Playable,But--
Jill,Female,Playable,"Chris, get in contact with Brad right away!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Okay!
Voice,,Non-Playable,There is three minutes until explosion.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I made it! I set off the triggering system to the bomb!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Great! Rebecca, Brad's up in the helicopter!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Look at those monsters!
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,"Chris, if Brad is in the helicopter, get in contact with him by any means!"
Chris,Male,Playable,But--
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I'll hold back the monsters!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Okay, I trust you."
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Trust me!
Voice,,Non-Playable,There is three minutes until explosion.
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,I made it! I set off the triggering system to the bomb!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Great! Rebecca, Brad's up in the helicopter!"
Rebecca,Female,Non-Playable,Look at those monsters!!!
