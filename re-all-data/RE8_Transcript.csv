Ethan,Male,Playable,"Okay… where to start. My name… it's Ethan. Ethan Winters. It's been 3 years since everything happened at the Baker house. I was looking for my wife who disappeared. I got an email from her. She told me to come get her… and of course it's how I get in the middle of nowhere. Louisiana… I find Mia being held captive in a dark basement. She wasn't thinking right… she attacked me like some kind of wild animal. Later on I find out that she was infected by a special kind of mold. I looked all over the house trying to find an antidote. A vaccine, anything. The people who live there were already infected. What was left of them wasn't human. There’s so something infection was a bio weapon that look like a little girl. Her name was Evelyn. I fought the fucked up family and being able to treat Mia's symptoms with the serum… when Chris Redfield and his soldier buddies showed up and saved both of us. Is that enough? I really don't want to talk about what happened anymore."
Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"Long ago, a young girl went with her mother to pick berries for her father who was hard at work. But the forest greeted them with a dark, cold silence, the bushes empty. Yet, determined to find the berries, the rascal broke free from Mother's grasp and vanished into the trees. Mother's worried cries faded fast as the girl ran on; over vine, and under branch and into the forest deep. Feeling strange eyes upon her, the girl recalled Mother's scary bedtime tales and her throat became bone dry. Then the Bat Lord appeared! He greeted, her warmly and bit his own wing. “Come, child. Quench your thirst,” he said. So she drank the thick, dark blood and smiled with joy. Passing through a graveyard, menacing storm clouds loomed and the air turned bitingly cold. Passing through a graveyard, menacing storm clouds loomed and the air turned bitingly cold. The girl was shivering in her thin clothes. Then a Dark Weaver appeared, and with a click of his fingers, crafted mist into a beautiful dress. “Come, child, warm yourself,” he coaxed. So she clothed herself and smiled with joy. Across waters deep and ominous she went, hoping a boat she found would carry her home. But hunger's grip tightened and her heart grew heavy. Then the Fish King appeared and offered one of his many fins. “Come, child. Eat your fill.” So the girl ate and smiled with joy once more. Continuing on, she soon entered the forest's dark heart. Then an Iron Steed appeared, bearing a beautiful, golden gear. The creature said nothing as the girl approached… …and snatched what she thought was another gift. The horse grew angry and summoned the other monsters. Terror filled the girl's heart as a wild wind rose about the beasts. Suddenly, a witch appeared-dark, yet regal."
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"“Gifts we gave, but more you took,” she snarled. “So more, in turn, is due.” “In a blink, the girl was trapped inside a mirror.” There. She's asleep."
Ethan,Male,Playable,What is with the creepy story? She's only six months old.
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,Woman at the store said it was traditional.
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"A local tale. Besides, Rose doesn't seem to mind."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Because she doesn't understand it, thank god. We moved here so that she wouldn't have to deal with any of that, remember?"
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,There’s nothing wrong with my memory. You're just being paranoid.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"It's not—never mind I'm sorry. But I’m not paranoid, I'm just cautious."
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"Then, go cautiously take your daughter to bed. I'll finish dinner."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"It's OK, Rose. Your mother doesn't want to remember. I can't blame her."
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,Did you say something?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Nothing—I'll put her down.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Her birthday will be here before we know it.
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,They grow up fast. Let's just enjoy it while we can.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"There, there. It's like I said to your mom—that book's too scary for you."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Your mom and I love this song so much.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Almost there, honey."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"There you go, sweetheart. Don't you worry, I'll be right downstairs. Daddy won't let those weird fairy tale monsters get you."
Ethan,Male,Playable,I wish it could stay like this forever.
Ethan,Male,Playable,It's not paranoia if they're really out to get you.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Rose is fine.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Why do I even keep this around? I should get rid of it someday.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Gotta do a deep clean before Rose starts walking around.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Everyone's forgotten about this already….
Ethan,Male,Playable,She's going to grow up beautiful.
Ethan,Male,Playable,She's asleep.
Ethan,Male,Playable,She's started to outgrow them.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Oh, Mia…what a miracle."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Three years ago, I couldn't even imagine, something like this would happen."
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,Is she OK?
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Sleeping like a…well, like a baby. Mm, that smells good. What's that?"
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"Hands off, mister. It's ciorba de legume. It's a local recipe."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Wow. You've gone full native, haven't you?"
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"Local wine, too. But if you're going to keep sulking all evening, maybe you shouldn't have any. You really have to stop worrying."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"It's just… Finding you in Louisiana, the pregnancy.Chris moving us here, military training—It all happened so fast, you know?"
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"Well, at least we're all together. You, me, Rose. Now everything’s going to be—"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Seriously? You think we can just forget what happened in Louisiana?
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,It happened so long ago. I just I don't understand why you are so—
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,Wha—!?
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Mia, get down!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,ΜΙΑ!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Mia. Oh, god…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Chris…!? What the hell!?
Chris,Male,Playable,"Sorry, Ethan."
Ethan,Male,Playable,No! What!? Why!?
Soldier,,Non-Playable,"Go on, move!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Rose? What the hell are you doing with my daughter?
Chris,Male,Playable,Take him away.
Ethan,Male,Playable,I said get your hands off her!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Ethan, no!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Rose…
Chris,Male,Playable,Get him out of here.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Hey, Doc."
Doctor,,Non-Playable,"Hello, Mr. Winters. I've got your daughter’s results back, and I'd like you to come in to talk about them. How about next Thursday, four o'clock?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"No problem, we'll be there. That was the Doc. She'll see us next week. Hey, now. Think positively, all right? We talked about this."
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"I know. We hardly talk about anything else. I keep telling you, it's not Rose that I'm worried about."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Well then, what are you worried about? Look, she's going to be fine, I just know it! What else matters?"
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"We matter, Ethan! YOU matter! You just won’t—"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Mia, what are you talking about? Is there something you're not telling me? Come on, talk to me!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Dammit, I have to take this."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Ugh… Jesus…
Man,Male,Non-Playable,About damn time! What's your status? Is the package safe?
Ethan,Male,Playable,"What are you talking about? Where's Chris Redfield, and Rose?"
Man,Male,Non-Playable,"Who is this? This is a secure channel, you are not authorized to use this."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Fuck! What the hell happened here?
Ethan,Male,Playable,What did all this?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Where the hell am I?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Maybe—maybe they're out?
Ethan,Male,Playable,What happened?
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Aah! No no! Friendly, friendly!"
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,Who are you? Who sent you?
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Nobody! There was an accident, down on the road, and—"
Ethan,Male,Playable,What's going on?
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, no. They're coming!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Who is? What the hell was that?
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,Do you have a gun?
Ethan,Male,Playable,What?
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,Please tell me you have a gun!
Ethan,Male,Playable,No. Why would I?
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,It's all I can spare. Take it! Take it!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Tell me what's out there! Hey, are you listening? Hey!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the—!?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Ah! Shit!
Ethan,Male,Playable,A dead body? Wait…there's more… Jesus Christ… What the hell is wrong with this place?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Get off! Shit!
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the fuck was that!? No! St-Stay back!
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the hell?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Surrounded. Dammit!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Is it…over?
Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"Hello? If there are any survivors out there, come to my—to Luiza's house near the fields."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Survivors?
Ethan,Male,Playable,OK. Dammit.
Ethan,Male,Playable,There's no end to them!
Ethan,Male,Playable,You're kidding me!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Wait, w-wait…"
Old Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"In life and in death, we give glory…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Uh, hello? You shouldn't be out here. It's not safe. What the hell? Hey, can you hear me?"
Old Woman,Female,Non-Playable,It's you? The child's father.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Child? Hey, wait-do you mean Rose? Is she here?"
Old Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"Rose, Rose, yes! She is in great danger. Since Mother Miranda brought her to the village, we have fallen into darkness!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,What are you talking about? The monsters?
Old Woman,Female,Non-Playable,The castle bell heralds danger! They're coming!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"No, wait! Where's Rose? Who's “Mother Miranda?"
Old Woman,Female,Non-Playable,The bell tolls for us all! They're coming again!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Rose is here?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Guess this leads to the castle.
Frightened Woman,Female,Non-Playable,Close the door! Please!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,Stay back!
Frightened Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"Please, don't hurt us!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Whoa. It's OK. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm just glad to see normal people at last. Have you seen any other survivors?
Frightened Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"No, they're all in Luiza's house. And she's not answering, and the gate is locked."
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,"Quiet, girl! He's an outsider!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Shit, we're sitting ducks in here. Can your old man walk?"
Frightened Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"No, one of the monsters cut him! He's lost a lot of blood—we have to get into Luiza's house!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Shh… quiet! There must be a way inside. Stay here, be quiet, and don't move until I get those gates open."
Ethan,Male,Playable,C'mon—it's clear!
Frightened Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"Hurry, hurry!"
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,Took your damn time.
Ethan,Male,Playable,You're welcome.
Frightened Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"He's not used to relying on other people. I'm sorry. We'll be safe in here, won't we?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Safer here than out there, that's for sure. Hey, do you know anything about what's going on around here?"
Frightened Woman,Female,Non-Playable,It doesn't make any sense. Mother Miranda has always protected us—
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,Nobody's answering! Come help me—
Frightened Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"Father!? We have to get inside! Just hold on a bit longer, Papa."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Hello? Anybody home?
Frightened Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"Maybe a familiar voice… Luiza, open up! It's me, Elena!"
Man,Male,Non-Playable,Stop shouting. You'll draw the monsters!
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,"Julian, calm down."
Julian,Male,Non-Playable,Who's this?
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,A friend—
Julian,Male,Non-Playable,Stay back!
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,"Father! For god's sake, Julian, let us in."
Julian,Male,Non-Playable,"No, no, they'll smell the blood—You'll endanger us all!"
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,My father will die out here!
Julian,Male,Non-Playable,That's not my problem!
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,What's going on?
Julian,Male,Non-Playable,These people want to let a dying man into our home.
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"Come now. “These people” are our friends. Go on, go inside. Come now, this way."
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,You're not from this village…
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Uh, no. I’m Ethan."
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"Julian, go make yourself useful and check the grounds. I said go!"
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"Well, if Elena trusts you… then so do I. Come inside, Ethan."
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"Wait here, I'll check on the others."
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"This way. Come inside, the others are waiting."
Drunk Guy,Male,Non-Playable,What the fuck is this? Outsiders—you're going to get us all killed!
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"Quiet, Anton. He helped Leonardo and Elena."
Leonardo,Male,Non-Playable,We were doing fine by ourselves!
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"Please, Ethan, take a seat."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Is this all that's left? From your entire village?
Anton,Male,Non-Playable,"All that's left? All that's left!? There is no one left! A worthless invalid! A stupid, wailing bitch…! And you! You drag a bloody man and an outsider in here like it's nothing… …and expect to be all safe? There is no safe! Every sorry bastard out there has been ripped in half! But tomorrow… Tomorrow we'll all be dead. Just like her damn husband! Put a sock in it, Roxana!"
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"That's enough! This house has protected my family for generations. And drunk or not, you are all welcome—and safe—in here."
Anton,Male,Non-Playable,Whatever.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Can someone please tell me what the hell is going on here?
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"We don't know. One day we were a quiet, devout village—and the next the monsters came and attacked us. And they—they kept coming, and—"
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,"Wait, Luiza, where is your husband. Did they…?"
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"No, n-no. He is out there—somewhere… H-He went to get help. Yes, yes, that's—that's it. He went to fetch help."
Roxana,Female,Non-Playable,Let us pray. For him. For all of us.
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,Good idea. Come. Gather.
Everyone,,Non-Playable,"Great ones, hear our voice, together as one in reverence. We call on thee within the endless dark to deliver us into fate's hands. As the midnight moon rises on black wings, so we make our sacrifice and await the light at the end. In life and in death, we give glory, Mother Miranda."
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"Now, the tea should be ready. Come help me, Elena, please."
Ethan,Male,Playable,That prayer—I've heard it before. There was an old woman near the graveyard.
Leonardo,Male,Non-Playable,You mean the hag? Dumb bitch is crazy as a bag of rats.
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"There is wisdom in her devotion, though… And I hope it protected her as it shall protect us."
Anton,Male,Non-Playable,What the fuck are you doing!?
Luiza,Female,Non-Playable,"Leonardo, what's wrong? Are you OK?"
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,Father!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Elena, no! Stay back!"
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,No—let me go!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Oh god, no. He'll kill us both! We have to go!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Elena?
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,I said no!
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,"Oh my god. I'm so sorry, Father…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Hey, hey. That wasn't your father anymore. You did the right thing. Elena. Elena, no. There's nothing you can do!"
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,Father!
Ethan,Male,Playable,This entire place is collapsing!
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,Father! Father!
Ethan,Male,Playable,You couldn't save him. He was already gone.
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,Leave me alone.
Ethan,Male,Playable,No. We're getting out of here—together. I gotta get outta here…
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Damn, the fire's moving fast!"
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,What are you thinking?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Step back. We can bust out with this.
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,Ethan! Ethan! Are you alright!?
Ethan,Male,Playable,I-I'm fine. Let me back up again.
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,The fire—there isn't any time!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Nowhere to go but up. Grab on. Hurry! Let's move!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Don't worry, and try not to breath in the smoke."
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,"I know. Thank you, Ethan. You're kind. I hope your family is safe."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"I do too. Once you get out of here maybe you'll get to meet them. Come on, it'll hold."
Ethan,Male,Playable,There! That's our way out.
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,Thank god! But what then? The village is still full of monsters. We can't fight them! There's too many!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Hey! Hey. Don't talk like that. We'll find a safe house to put you in until I can find my daughter. My hunch is she's in that old castle.
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,No! That place is full of nothing but blood and death! And I don't want to be alone while you're—
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,Father?
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Elena, no! That's not him—not anymore!"
Leonardo,Male,Non-Playable,Elena…
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,He said my name! Father!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Wait, it's not safe!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Stay there! C'mon, give me your hand!"
Elena,Female,Non-Playable,"Ethan, go… Save your daughter!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Elena, don't give up! Reach for me!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,God dammit! Why is everyone dying on me!? This is… this is just too much. I just… don't get it. This place has gone mad. Why the fuck is this happening again!? Shit!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Who's there!?
Man,Male,Non-Playable,Stop! Mother Miranda!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Hey! Who was—what was that?
Old Woman,Female,Non-Playable,Death. Yes. Death has visited them all!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"“Nothing but blood and death,” huh?"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Well, well. Didn't think anyone was left! You must be pretty tough, huh?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Who the fuck are you?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, you're not local! Even better."
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,Mother Miranda's gonna love you!
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,Quit your whining: we're almost there!
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,The man is of no real use to anyone else. And my daughters do so love… entertaining foreigners.
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"Furthermore, I can assure you if you entrust the mortal to House Dimitrescu, my daughters and I shall deliver to you the finest cups of his slaughtered blood."
Doll,Female,Non-Playable,"Out of the way, ugly! I want to see—oh! He’s awake!"
Deformed Freak,,Non-Playable,You mean—Y-You mean…?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Both of you, shut the fuck up!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,What…? Where…?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Yo mean you'll screw around with him in private, and where's the fun in that? Give him to me and I’ll put on a show that everybody can enjoy."
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"Oh, so gauche. What do we care for bread and circuses? The manthing's suffering is assured, regardless."
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Yack, yack. And if a man’s dick is cut off in the castle—blah, blah, blah!"
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"I've heard all your arguments. Some of you were less persuasive than others, but… I've made my decision. Heisenberg. The man's fate is in your hands."
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"Mother Miranda, I must protest! Heisenberg is but a child, and his devotion to you is questionable. Give the mortal to me, and I will ensure he is ready."
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,Shut your damn hole and don't be a sore loser! Go find your food somewhere else.
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"Quiet now, child! Adults are talking."
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,I'm the child? You're the one who's arguing with Miranda's decision!
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,You wouldn't know responsibility if it was welded to that hammer!
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, keep growing, one day your head might actually fit your ego!"
Doll,Female,Non-Playable,"Fight, fight, fight, fight!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Hey, don't I get a say in this?"
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"SILENCE! My decision is final, there will be no argument. Remember from whence you came!"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,Thank you.
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Lycans and gentlemen, we thank you for waiting! And now let the games begin! Let's see what you're really made of, Ethan Winters. Get ready!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"No, wait!"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Showtime!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Agh! Jesus Christ!
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"That's right! Run for your life! Very nice, Ethan!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"No, no!"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,You're still alive? Impressive…
Ethan,Male,Playable,Oh shit. Shit!
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Haha! My word, you truly are as strong as they say!"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, you didn't think I'd let you get away, did you? Gotta keep Donna and Moreau entertained! So, now it's time for the beautiful, blood-soaked grand finale! Hahaha! Nothing like fresh American ground beef!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Too close… Wait. Do those freaks have Rose?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"I've been waiting for you, Mister Winters."
Ethan,Male,Playable,How do you know my name?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Anyone who is anyone has heard of the likes of you. A hero searching for his daughter. Though I must say, that castle arouses suspicion."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Yeah, and so do you."
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,I am but a humble merchant.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Here?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Forgive my manners, call me the Duke, Now to business. Weapons, ammunition, healing salves—Anything you desire, I can provide. Seeking something in particular? I've prepared a special present for you!"
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Hard times, Ethan? What're ya buyin’?—Haha, just something an old friend of mine used to say. Please come again."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Could Rose be here…?
Woman,Female,Non-Playable,Looking for Rose?
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the—?
Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"Mmmm, man-blood."
Woman,Female,Non-Playable,Mother. I bring you fresh prey.
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"You are so kind to me, daughters. Now, let's take a look at him. Well, well. Ethan Winters. You escaped my little brother's idiot games, did you? Let's see how special you are."
Daughters,Female,Non-Playable,"Yes, Mother."
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,Hm. Starting to go a little stale.
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"Now, now, daughters First, I must inform Mother Miranda. But later… Well, there will be enough for everyone. Put him up!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Hey, hey wait…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Hey. Let me… down!
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"Oh, careful what you wish for, Ethan Winters."
Ethan,Male,Playable,W-Wait! Wh-Wh-What are you doing?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Bunch of crazy witches…
Ethan,Male,Playable,Where have they taken Rose…?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,We meet again.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Duke? Why are you here?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Where there's coin to be made… And have you found your daughter?
Ethan,Male,Playable,No.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"If she is truly here, the Lady of the castle would have kept little Rose in her private chambers, would she not?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Dimitrescu?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"The very same. Why don't you take a look? Maybe you'll get lucky. And speaking of looking… care to make a purchase? Seeking something in particular? I am skilled at all sorts of weapons modifications, and will do them for a small fee."
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Thank you for your patronage!
Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,"I haven't cut open a man in a while! Let me string you up, slice your jugular, and just watch…. Taken alive? Dead? Which would you prefer?"
Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,"I can't believe Cassandra caused all this mess. A healthy man's blood… mmm, I can't wait."
Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,"I need blood. Warm, wet, bright red blood. Where are you going, little one?"
Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,Your bullets cannot harm—
Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,You stupid manthing!
Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,"I won't forgive you, you bastard! Not like this…"
Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,Give up! I don't believe it!
Second Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,Shall give you the tour?
Second Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,"Ugh, so thirsty…"
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,What have you done to my daughter!?
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the hell!?
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"Mother Miranda. I regret to inform you that Ethan Winters, has escaped that fool Heisenberg. Because he is in my castle, and has already proven too much for my daughters to handle! When I find him—No, Mother Miranda. Yes, of course I understand the importance of the ceremony. I won't let you down."
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,To hell with the ceremony! That man will pay for what he's done…
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Rose, where are you?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Oh, shit."
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,There you are. All this for a child that isn't even here!
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the hell do—
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"You ungrateful, selfish wretch! You come into MY house— You lay your filthy man-hands on MY daughters— And now you even try to steal my property? How dare you!?"
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"Rest while you can, because I will hunt you, and I will break you!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Go ahead, do your worst!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Aah, shit!"
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,Like I'd let you get away. You'll be sliced to ribbons——before you ever see that child!
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,You will learn what it means to insult house Dimitrescu.
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"Time to die! Ah, such a nimble little mouse."
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,Running will get you nowhere!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Good. Man, screw this castle!"
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,It's a pleasure to see you safe. How were things?
Ethan,Male,Playable,No sign of Rose.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"I'm… so sorry it turned out that way. Well, you'll find your way to her once you're out of this castle. Do you have need of anything for the road ahead? Thanks to your consistent patronage, I've expanded my services. If it's just looking, window shop away."
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"As always, a trustworthy, fair exchange. One moment, please. This is all an investment, Ethan. Please come again."
Second Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,"Trying to work up my appetite, are you?"
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,You disgusting outsider!
Second Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,Hmm. I guess I should hold back a little.
Second Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,Play with me some more.
Second Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,I was worried my sisters had gotten to you first.
Second Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,You've ruined the hunt!
Second Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,You bastard! My body! What? No! You're done! You will not get away! You're my prey… mine…
Ethan,Male,Playable,Crazy witch.
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,You disgusting outsider!
Third Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,So you finally came to see me! Everyone falls for me in time.
Third Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,"Ugh! Ow, so mean! You really want to kill me!? Why are you doing this!? Ugh, damn! A dream. This is a dream. I don't wanna… die…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,I'm sick of bugs.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"OK, I should be able to get out with these."
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"Stupid manthing! You won't live long, even if you run!"
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,You've ruined everything!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Oh shit!
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"Flesh, bones, I will devour all of you!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Looks like your outside matches your inside now, psycho witch."
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,You'll die a painful death!
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,"I will destroy you! You're a lucky man, Ethan! Besides Miranda, you're the only one to ever see me in this form. Too bad you'll pay for it… with your life! I will never forgive you! Too late for regrets! I'll crush you, you scum! I'll tear you limb from limb! Disgusting garbage! How dare you talk about saving your daughter when you've murdered mine!? You human pest! You would take everything from me!? I'll crush you! You can't escape! Like hell you'll kill me! Eat you… I'll eat you! Agh, just give up! Your daughter belongs to us, now! Rose is our only hope! We won't hand her over to the likes of you! Not enough blood! More! More blood! I need your flesh! You've got nowhere else to go, Ethan! Come now, don't be shy. Show me your terror! Now… time to die! I’ll eat you up, every last morsel! Die! Die! Damn you, Winters!"
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,It's too late… you'll never see your Rose again… Succumb to your despair!
Lady Dimitrescu,Female,Non-Playable,Curse you!
Ethan,Male,Playable,You're the one who's cursed.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Looks like I'm getting outta this place.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Rose…
Old Woman,Female,Non-Playable,"As the midnight moon rises on black wings, we await the light at the end… In life and in death, glory to Mother Miranda."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Hey, remember me? I almost died up at that castle. Tell me what is going on around here?"
Old Woman,Female,Non-Playable,How can a man be “almost” dead? That's a question for the wise.
Ethan,Male,Playable,You know what I mean. And I still haven't found Rose. Where did Mother Miranda take her?
Old Woman,Female,Non-Playable,You're too late! Or maybe…”almost” too late? The child will be sacrificed. Life for life.
Ethan,Male,Playable,What kind of sick medieval shit is this? She's just a baby!
Old Woman,Female,Non-Playable,The crests of the four bloodlines may open the path you seek..
Ethan,Male,Playable,Will you please stop talking in riddles? I just want to find my daughter.
Old Woman,Female,Non-Playable,It's only a riddle if you don't know the answer.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Wait a second, that looks familiar. Hey! Hey, wait!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Is this…?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,There you are. I had a feeling you would pop up here.
Ethan,Male,Playable,It was all worthless.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Is that so? I assume you've picked up something of value.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Not sure if it's of value, but…"
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Why—you have your daughter right in your own hands.
Ethan,Male,Playable,What are you saying?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Take a closer look.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,That flask seems to contain her head.
Ethan,Male,Playable,No… Wh-Wha-?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Rose is—
Ethan,Male,Playable,Don’t say another word! This—this is impossible! This just can't be…!
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Your daughter's essence is still intact. Her powers are truly unique.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Who—who could even do this?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,She can be saved you know?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Saved? From this? Are you insane!?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,There's a house with a red chimney on the western side of the village. Go and seek out the man who lives there. Then we can continue our conversation.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Quit holding out and get to the damn point!
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"You don't have to trust my words, but do you have any better options? Your choice. The customer is always right, after all."
Ethan,Male,Playable,You'll pay if I find out this is a lie.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Fucking joker…!
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the hell?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Naturally. Oh, Lady Dimitrescu! Beautiful even in death. That waistline… yes! This simple modification can be done in just a moment. Please come again. Oh good. I was just thinking of ways to pass the time. I see, anything else? Thank you for your patronage!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Damn it… Better see Duke again.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,How was it? Did you learn anything?
Ethan,Male,Playable,I found these feathers. Now tell me how to fix this like you said you would.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Settle down. First you must use that key and collect all of your little Rose's flasks.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Where are the rest of them?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"There are four in total. You have the one, and the other lords have the rest."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Lords?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Mother Miranda is the cold, calculating ruler of this village. Four lords serve under her. The first you've already met, the lady Dimitrescu. The second lives deep in a valley of mist, the doll maker Donna Beneviento. None of her playmates have ever come back from that dank, old estate. The third is Moreau, a being of twisted flesh that lives in the reservoir past the windmills. It's said that he is not the only monster that lives in those waters. The fourth and most dangerous is Heisenberg. He works in his factory on the village outskirts. And the project? Let's just say parts of the human imagination are better left alone."
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"If you truly wish to save your daughter, you must first gather the four flasks. I'll do you a personal favor. I've marked the Lords' locations on your map. Some treasures still lurk in this village. I'm sure each one will prove of great use to you."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Why are you doing all this?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Why it's all part of our first class customer service. Please do come again soon…
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Shall I choose something for you? Ah yes, I have you! Find some quality ingredients and bring them to me. You kill it, we cook it! Hand over ingredients. We've gathered all the ingredients! Now… Here it is. Please, join me!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Not a bad dish.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"I'm buying this because of our relationship, you know. I'm surprised you'd part with this so early. I hope this one makes itself useful. I am skilled at all sorts of weapons modifications, and will do them for a small fee. Have a wonderful adventure!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,What?
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,Ethan! Come with me. There's something I have to tell you.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Mia? What's going on?
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"Rose feels different. Ethan, you have to fix her…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the hell is this?
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,Everyone leaves me… even Rose… I don't want to be alone…
Ethan,Male,Playable,This can't be real…
Ethan,Male,Playable,Am I losing it?
Ethan,Male,Playable,What's going on?
Doll,Female,Non-Playable,I've been waiting for so long… I'd make a much better daughter than Rose. Please won't you stay with me forever?
Ethan,Male,Playable,What?
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Wait, where's my gun?"
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"Whoa, that's a kick! Can you believe it? S-She's so energetic, it's crazy!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Why is this here?
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"Oh god, no… I, I can't tell Ethan anything but this."
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"Please Ethan, listen to me. I didn't want to keep it from you."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Mia?
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,I didn't want to lose you again—I didn't want to destroy this family.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Mia, what are you talking about?"
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,I love you both so much I had to. I had to do it.
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,Rose…
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,It'll be fine. It'll be fine. It'll be fine. It'll be fine. It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
Woman In Black,Female,Non-Playable,Don't leave… I can't let you…
Doll,Female,Non-Playable,"Ooh, you're still alive, huh?"
Doll,Female,Non-Playable,"You better find me quick, before my friends murder you! Tick-tock! Your life's on the line!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Wait!
Doll,Female,Non-Playable,"Try and find me, haha!"
Doll,Female,Non-Playable,Everything would be better if Rose wasn't born
Ethan,Male,Playable,Fucking monster!
Doll,Female,Non-Playable,You do this to Rose too?
Doll,Female,Non-Playable,You are never going to get out of here!
Doll,Female,Non-Playable,Stupid idiot! What are you doing to my cute friends!?
Ethan,Male,Playable,It's… over?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Mia… I’ll make things right.
Ethan,Male,Playable,What?
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Good, I need to get out of this place,"
Ethan,Male,Playable,So that's who was behind all this.
Ethan,Male,Playable,That makes two…
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Does this look familiar to you…?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Ooh! Where did you get your hands on such a thing? I saw you eyeing that one! Please come again.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Now this is something to splurge on!
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Securing goods is more important than anything. Anything, my friend. Please come again."
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, Mother Miranda… If it's for you, I'd do anything!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,I'll just be taking this…
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,"Wait, wait,wait! Wh-What are you doing with Mother's special child!?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,She's not hers.
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,Oh? You have something to say?
Ethan,Male,Playable,"What do you mean, “Mother's special child?"
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,Mother wants her baby back.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Don’t screw with me!
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,"Wait, wait, wait! Please, please! If, if you take it, then the others will laugh at me… B-But if, if I do better than them…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,What do I care?
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,"Wait, just a little longer, ple—!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,What's so funny?
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,"You're stupid! You talk too much! It's all over, I plugged the way in."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Wh-What're you…?
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,This is MY territory! And I won't let you leave!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Shit! Damn freak!
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,W-Wait! Don't go! Dirty little sneak thief. I-I won't let you have it.
Ethan,Male,Playable,How do I get out of here?
Ethan,Male,Playable,What was that?
Ethan,Male,Playable,"What the hell? A research post, or something…? What the fuck are they doing here?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Get off of me!
Soldier,,Non-Playable,Stay the fuck down!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Ethan. I gotta say, I'm surprised you made it this far. It'd be a shame if something happened to you now."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Sure, Chris. Why not? You killed Mia! Now do me and finish the job!"
Chris,Male,Playable,What kind of readings? What's moving?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Hey. Hey! Did you say Miranda? How are you involved?
Chris,Male,Playable,"Leave it alone, Ethan. You are out of your depth. What about the sample analysis?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"You stay out of our business, Ethan."
Ethan,Male,Playable,What business? I don’t—
Chris,Male,Playable,Watch out!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Shit! Stay back!
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,You… The exit's underwater… you're done!
Ethan,Male,Playable,I don't have time for this.
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,It's too late… Miranda is already preparing the ceremony!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Miranda sent you to slow me down? You're pathetic.
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,Don't be cruel! It's not fair! I should be with her! Not you!
Ethan,Male,Playable,What are you talking about?
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the fuck is wrong with you?
Moreau,Male,Non-Playable,"I can't hold it in anymore! Oh God. Oh, Mother why? Why!?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,What am I supposed to do? He said the exit's underwater. If I can drain the water…
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Shit, there's no power."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Ugh, seriously…?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,I'm not looking to be fish food.
Moreau The Giant Toad,,Non-Playable,Up and down!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Damn.
Ethan,Male,Playable,It stinks.
Moreau The Giant Toad,,Non-Playable,"I'm the best! Watch me, Mama! I'll do better next time, Momma…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Caught myself a big one.
Ethan,Male,Playable,I need to get out of here!
Ethan,Male,Playable,OK!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Got it!
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Ah, yes, yes… As always, a trustworthy, fair exchange."
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Finished! I'd love for you to enjoy, as well. I wouldn't mind having that again. I've gotten some new stock! I saw you eyeing that one! Have a wonderful adventure!"
Moreau The Giant Toad,,Non-Playable,My precious water! No!
Moreau The Giant Toad,,Non-Playable,"I'll make you proud, Mother. Watch me!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,I guess I gotta do this.
Moreau The Giant Toad,,Non-Playable,"Get out of my way! Take, take this! Stop! You bastard! Why do you hate me? You're the reason Mother doesn't love me. I've, I've been saving this one. Oh, why? Stop picking on me! Don't look at me that way! Please Mother Miranda, I'm trying. I'm not stupid! D-Don't run. Ugh…this… isn't fair… Listen to me! Nooooo!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Can't get caught in that.
Moreau The Giant Toad,,Non-Playable,Stop! Ha ha! I don't want to die. Oh it hurts so much. Don't look at me that way!
Moreau The Giant Toad,,Non-Playable,Damn you! H-Help me! Mother! Maaaaaaaaaaaa—!
Ethan,Male,Playable,In death as he was in life. Disgusting. The exit's up ahead…
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,You're better off than I thought.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Who's that?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh come on, we just met a while back! Not that it has a matters…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"You're the last asshole in my way, aren't you?"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"You've got fight, I'll give you that, Ethan. But what's the plan when you have all four flasks?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,What're you trying to get at?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,I could lend you a hand.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Trying to get on my good side?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Don't get cocky. I'd kill you if you weren't worth the trouble… There's a stronghold not too far outside the village. Go there and get my flask. Do that, and you pass. First, head back to the graveyard."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Self-centered prick.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Ah…my apologies. Please do take a look at my new stock. This is Lord Moreau's? I suppose it's what they call the beauty of the grotesque? These hands are more dexterous than one might think. Hmm? What? Ah, it's fine. All finished. Securing goods is more important than anything. Anything, my friend. I can hardly wait for the next ingredients! Ah, yes, yes… I saw you eyeing that one! To hunger… is to be alive. Thank you for your patronage!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,How do I get this door open?
Ethan,Male,Playable,This must be their den.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"OK, big guy!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,That's not good.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Eat shit.
Ethan,Male,Playable,W-What?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"You're the real deal, Ethan. Well done."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Quit hiding, asshole. I'm not letting you get out of this."
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Cool your jets. Just a little bit more and you're all wrapped up. I'll lend you a hand, so in exchange…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,In exchange what?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"First of all, come to me. Put all the flasks in the Altar, and I'm sure you'll figure the rest out. See you, Ethan."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Goddammit.
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Don't worry about the kid, Ethan. It’ll be fine. Just get your ass across the bridge!"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Ah, Ethan Winters. Welcome. I didn't think you'd make it past Donna or Moreau, but I suppose you survived worse back in America, hm?"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"I like you. I'd like to speak to you about Rose and Miranda. Oh come on in. Don't worry, it's not a trap."
Ethan,Male,Playable,What’re you planning?
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the hell..?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Mia!?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Truth hurts, don't it?"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Let me guess. You're thinking take me out like the others, and then you get to go and save Rose, right?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,I'm healing my daughter.
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,Look. y-you've got this all wrong—
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Dammit, I'm talking here! Shut your fucking hole! Sorry about that."
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,Take a seat.
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Listen, Ethan. You're being played."
Ethan,Male,Playable,What are you talking about? You think this is a game?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"I said sit! Lady super-sized bitch… Ugly-ass psycho doll… ...and that moronic freak. Don't you get it? It's a test, to see if you're strong enough… ...to be part of Miranda's family."
Ethan,Male,Playable,I don't WANT to be part of Miranda's family—
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Neither did I! But here we are. And I'm next in line, right? Kill me, move up the chain! Well, fuck that!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,I don't give a damn about your personal issues! I just want to fix my daughter!
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,So do I! Do you have any idea how powerful that kid is? Even Miranda's scared of her—
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Last time, you freak, I swear to god… You and me, Ethan. Together we go save Rose, and then we can use her to grind Miranda into paste."
Ethan,Male,Playable,My daughter is not a weapon! Fuck you!
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,Last chance. You don't want to find out what's in that hole.
Ethan,Male,Playable,I'll take my chances.
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,Your funeral.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Dammit! Shit!
Ethan,Male,Playable,A dead end! Dammit!
Ethan,Male,Playable,What was that thing? This place is messed up. I've gotta get upstairs.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Welcome, welcome! You're sure to find something new. Shall I choose something for you? Hoho - you've brought in something special. You'll be slaughtering things in droves! Till next we meet."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Did he do this too? Can’t surprise me anymore.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Could use this.
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh Ethan, such a disappointment."
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"I thought we could join forces against that bitch Miranda. Truly, truly disappointing. She took me. Took us. To be her children. She locked us away in the village. Decades of being forced to serve her. Can you even understand that humiliation? I'm not like my siblings. I want nothing more than to be free of that bitch. So I need power. I need enough power to destroy her. These are the fruits of my power. The strong will destroy the weak. That's the way of the world! You should have never refused me, Ethan."
Ethan,Male,Playable,What a freak.
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Medical log, revitalization surgery. This is my… 18th attempt. Subject is Oskar the stable boy, 20 years old. He fell down the well while drunk. Body's in good condition. Chest incision complete. Now to remove the heart and vital organs, and implant the control device. Excellent. Cadou has begun adhering to the nervous system, It's progressing even faster than before. It seems upping the ratio, of meta-albumin in the artificial blood was the right choice. Now to pass a current through the brain stem using 6600V. Come on… it has to work this time. Yes… Yes! Hahaha! Wonderful! My creation! At last! I'll get that bitch yet! Hahaha! …Ending recording."
Ethan,Male,Playable,You again!?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"I've expanded my services. Please, come take a look. You wish to make a purchase? I'm buying this because of our relationship, you know. Food is life. Good day, then! Got a long way to go."
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Miranda thinks we're nothing but children. Oh she doesn't care for us, no. She's long lost all her humanity. I must destroy her…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,I don't give a shit about your family drama.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Another one?
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Shit, that was close."
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Soon, she'll start her ceremony with your Rose. If that happens, it's all over. For your kid, and for the whole village. But don't worry, I'll stop it. I'll use Rose to kill Miranda. Haha, poor papa. You're the only one who doesn't see your kid's power."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Take Rose? Heh, I'd like to see you try."
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"You really are a tough one. But I'm tired of chit-chat. Time to die! You can hear it, can't you? Someone's waiting for you."
Ethan,Male,Playable,I don't have time for this bullshit. Out of my way!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Now stay down.
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the-?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Not bad, not bad, Winters. You're persistent, but I've got a rebellion to lead… …So stay out of my way."
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,Don't. Come. Back!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"That bastard. Damnit, again?"
Chris,Male,Playable,Gimme that.
Chris,Male,Playable,"I told you to leave it alone, Ethan. You are in the way."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"What do you care, Chris? You killed my wife, you son of a bitch!"
Chris,Male,Playable,You think I’d kill Mia? That wasn't her! It was Miranda.
Ethan,Male,Playable,…What?
Chris,Male,Playable,"She's a bioweapon. She changed her appearance and pretended to be Mia. It seems she also survived being shot, so now I'm here to finish the job."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Bullshit! Why didn't you fucking tell me right away!?
Chris,Male,Playable,Because I knew you would want to be involved! And this job is hard enough without civilians getting in the way.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Why us, Chris? What the hell is going on?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"All right, Ethan. All right. I guess I owe you an explanation. Hand me that wrench. Long story short, Miranda's fucking insane. And this village, all these monsters and freaks… this is her life's work. Some sort of crazy experiment with the mold."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"The mold. Like Louisiana. Goddammit. All this time, I thought I could save my family… I can't escape from here… I can't do anything!"
Chris,Male,Playable,That might not be true. Take a look at this. My men sent those pictures a few minutes ago.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Miranda.
Chris,Male,Playable,Keep looking.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Rose. Holy shit, we've gotta go!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Relax! My men are monitoring the situation.
Ethan,Male,Playable,But they have my daughter!
Chris,Male,Playable,"You don't get it, Ethan. You don't stand a chance against Miranda by yourself."
Chris,Male,Playable,"I will stay down here and finish planting explosives. You take that elevator, and I'll meet you topside. I promise you, we will get your daughter back. Together."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Damn straight we will. And when I find Miranda… she's a dead woman.
Chris,Male,Playable,"All right, Ethan. Then you take this—and do me a favor… Try to stay under the radar."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Can't turn back now.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Metal/polymer composite, huh? Time to fight fire with fire!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,I'm coming Rose!
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,You're like a goddamn cockroach! You think you can take me on?
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"Fine, this will be my warm-up before I kill that bitch. Let's settle this, mano a mano. Your corpse will be another addition to my army! This is the best! That one hurt! I promise! Haha! So this is the power of fatherly love, huh? Like that cannon huh? Impressed. Cower in the face of my steel glory! Guess I do have to thank that bitch Miranda for this. I'll kill her with the power she gave me. That's what I call being a good son, haha! Do you know how I felt spending years under the bitch's thumb? The villagers are nothing but a bunch of worthless peons! I’m goddamn freedom fighter! I'll use your cute little daughter to become more powerful than ever! The clock is ticking Ethan! Play time's over! Quit acting so full of yourself! I’m tired of your shit!"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"No, no! My metal army! I'm going to murder that boulder-punching asshole, but you're first. Now die like the world's watching you! Too bad I'm your only fan! Here we go Ethan, the final stretch! Well what do you think? It's hopeless, right? Just give up. Flesh and blood will never win against me! This isn't David and Goliath. It's Ethan and a bloody demise, haha! Come on!"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"So long, Ethan Winters! You really should have taken my deal. You'll meet Rose in the afterlife! Rose's power is mine! Right after I murder Miranda! Your funeral!"
Heisenberg,Male,Non-Playable,"No, no! This can't be the end for me! I… must… kill her!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Ethan!? I heard explosions. What the hell happened?
Ethan,Male,Playable,I dealt with Heisenberg. Now I'm going to find Miranda and get Rose back.
Chris,Male,Playable,"Not without me. It's too dangerous. Wait there, you hear me? Ethan?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Rose?
Chris,Male,Playable,"Ethan? Ethan, respond!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Mia… but!?
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"Our child… she's so important, isn't she?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,She's everything to me.
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"And mine to me. With Heisenberg gone, you've lost your lead. What are you going to do?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"I don't know, but I'm saving Rose."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Who are you? Where's Rose!?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Miranda!
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"Enough. Remember Eveline and her power over the mold? Rose is her successor. No… Rose is Eveline's true, complete form.She will grow to fully control the masses. And I must have her."
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Fuck you, you crazy bitch!"
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"Calm yourself. Rose will be saved. The Megamycete catalogs all of us. However, she will be reborn as my daughter."
Ethan,Male,Playable,She's my child! Not yours! Where are you? Show yourself!
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,Why did Rose come to be? Was it because of her parents? And you are truly a special case. But I've learned all I can from you. Your worth as a lab rat has run out.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Miranda, you coward! Come out and face me!"
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"Don't worry, Ethan. Your death will come quick. You will join the Megamycete's records."
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"I will make sure to sample your blood for later. Once dawn breaks the ceremony will be complete, and I will become her true mother. Bound for eternity in blood."
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"I've waited so long. But dreams really can come true. Vessel or not, I can't wait to see my true child again."
Soldier,,Non-Playable,"Captain, I've confirmed the death of Ethan Winters. I wasn't able to retrieve the body, but I've recorded evidence."
Chris,Male,Playable,Share your screen and I'll go over the situation. My team and I were careless. Yesterday we took down the transformed Miranda But we didn't kill her.
Soldier,,Non-Playable,Who knew she could take being a corpse?
Chris,Male,Playable,"Since Miranda could've infected Ethan, I forcefully took him and Rose with us. But the vehicle they were riding in was attacked. When I got to the wreck, Ethan and Rose were gone. The last time I was able to contact Ethan… I heard Miranda's voice. She murdered him. And she is not gonna get away with it. Goddammit, when does it end?"
Soldier,,Non-Playable,"What's that, sir? The mission?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"All of it. Three years, trying to put this thing in the ground. Three years too long."
Soldier,,Non-Playable,"We'll get her, Captain. The squad's ready for you."
Chris,Male,Playable,So BSAA got here already. They didn't waste any time.
Soldier,,Non-Playable,Mission adjustment?
Chris,Male,Playable,"No. It doesn't change anything. Terminate Miranda, and rescue Rose. That's the mission, and failure is not an option."
Chris,Male,Playable,Let's move out!
Soldier,,Non-Playable,Roger!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Canine, I want to know what the hell BSAA is doing here. Find out what you can."
Canine,Male,Non-Playable,Roger that. I'm on it.
Soldier,,Non-Playable,"Been a while since we fought together, Captain. When was it last, the desert?"
Woman Soldier,Female,Non-Playable,Doin' nothin' but recon's gotten me outta shape.
Chris,Male,Playable,"But thanks to your recon, we know Miranda's plan."
Soldier,,Non-Playable,"Couldn't quite believe it when I heard, she'd turned herself into Mia, though."
Chris,Male,Playable,BSAA…they've gone too far.
Chris,Male,Playable,Christ.
Chris,Male,Playable,First we're going to have to take that thing out.
Chris,Male,Playable,Everyone watch for hostile bioweapons.
Soldier,,Non-Playable,Roger.
Chris,Male,Playable,Made contact with a group of hostile bioweapons.
Chris,Male,Playable,Roger that.
Chris,Male,Playable,Don't get cocky.
Chris,Male,Playable,"That's probably where Miranda is. Let's go. Large, mutated bioweapon sighted."
Woman Soldier,Female,Non-Playable,"They had eyes on Miranda, too. Probably felt they needed to intervene."
Soldier,,Non-Playable,Hey Boss. It’s me. I'm at the location preparing for support fire. Might be a minute.
Chris,Male,Playable,Roger.
Woman Soldier,Female,Non-Playable,"Tundra here. Leaving some supplies in one of the houses, Captain, Help yourself."
Chris,Male,Playable,"Umber Eyes, I need some backup."
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,I see you. Two hundred to the point.
Soldier,,Non-Playable,I've never heard of a mutamycete colony growing so huge.
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey I got eyes on you, Boss. Keep going."
Chris,Male,Playable,"I've reached the target location. Damn this is big. All right Lobo, marking the target!"
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,"Roger that, Boss."
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,"Bingo, alright! Reloading now, just a minute. There's a swarm headed that way."
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,"OK, Captain. I'm reloaded. Read when you are. Mold is rapidly expanding. There must be something stimulating it."
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,"Another hit! Hah, looks like it's about to collapse. Hold your horses. I'm reloading. It's them. Watch your perimeter, Chris."
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,"BSAA guys are engaging the bioweapons. You're right, Captain, they must be after the Megamycete too."
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,How many are there? Everyone OK?
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,They're coming from the mold. There's no end to them…
Tundra,Female,Non-Playable,…Gimme a break!
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,Is the target locator working?
Canine,Male,Non-Playable,"Dammit, these things are using weapons!"
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,"Heh, sure they're thinking the same about you. Bioweapon numbers are increasing. We need to finish them off quick. Five more from the mountains. East side."
Tundra,Female,Non-Playable,I'm nearby. I'll handle 'em.
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,"Boom! Haha, take that!"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Good, The Megamycete must be below. I found a way down. I'm going in. The rest of you stay back."
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,"Captain, I've compared the mold at the village with a sample from the Bakers' and… there's no sign of the genome editing we saw in the E-series. The stuff originated here…"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Guarding the Megamycete, huh?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"Dammit, I'm getting nowhere. Lobo, I got a tough guy here! I'm gonna need backup!"
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,"Boss, you're underground!"
Chris,Male,Playable,There's an opening in the roof. Use it!
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,"OK, I'm moving out. Hold on 'til I get there!"
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,"I'm overhead, Boss."
Chris,Male,Playable,Good! I'll signal with the locator!
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,Give a guy a break…
Chris,Male,Playable,Nice! Thought so!
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,"Reloading now, just a minute. OK, Captain. I'm reloaded. Ready when you are. Hold your horses, I'm reloading. I'm reloaded. Where should I point next?"
Chris,Male,Playable,Hostile bioweapon eliminated.
Chris,Male,Playable,"I'll keep going. The rest of you, stay above ground."
Canine,Male,Non-Playable,"So if Miranda was the fake Mia, where's the real one?"
Lobo,Male,Non-Playable,"I doubt she saw any further use for her. I don't get any of this. How did Miranda even know Rose exists? A moldy, dittle bird told her, maybe?"
Chris,Male,Playable,We can figure that out later. Focus on the plan.
Chris,Male,Playable,I found it. It's the Megamycete. Alpha to squad. I've located the Megamycete.
Canine,Male,Non-Playable,So now we can end this mess after all…
Chris,Male,Playable,And about damn time.
Chris,Male,Playable,N2 explosive's armed. There's enough there to blow the whole village sky-high
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,Let's get out of here and blow the damn place.
Chris,Male,Playable,Not before I end Miranda. I'm not taking any more chances. I'm going in.
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,"Roger that, standing by. Captain, I have eyes on Miranda at the ceremony site."
Chris,Male,Playable,Keep your distance. Do not move until I give the order.
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,I know it's too late now but we really should have told Ethan the plan.
Chris,Male,Playable,There wasn't time and we didn't expect Miranda to act so soon.
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,"Even so, you should have told him."
Chris,Male,Playable,Yeah.
Chris,Male,Playable,This must be Miranda's lab.
Chris,Male,Playable,So they're using this to control the bioweapons.
Chris,Male,Playable,Spencer… here? No way…
Chris,Male,Playable,"Show me your hands! Umber Eyes, this is Alpha. Where is Miranda right now?"
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,"Still at the ceremony site. Whatever she's doing, she's staying put."
Chris,Male,Playable,"Goddamn. It really is you. I'm glad you're safe, Mia. Why are you here?"
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,I was caught…and used in experiments…
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,"Wait, did you say Mia? Mia Winters?"
Chris,Male,Playable,In the flesh. What's the situation up there?
Umber Eyes,Male,Non-Playable,Kind of a war going on. Nothing we can't handle.
Chris,Male,Playable,Don't get distracted. Stick to the mission. I'm headed to the ceremony site.
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"Wait! You can't leave me here! You promised, dammit! You said you'd keep us safe! We did everything you asked. We moved over here, everything! And I didn't care, so long as we were together. So you tell me, where is my husband? Where is my daughter!?"
Chris,Male,Playable,Ethan is… He's gone. I couldn't save him. But I can save Rose.
Chris,Male,Playable,"Come on, it's not safe here after all."
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"What do you mean, he's gone?"
Chris,Male,Playable,"He's dead. I'm sorry, Mia, but we have to leave. We have to destroy this village."
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"No! You're wrong… I tried to keep this a secret, but… You don't understand how special he is."
Ethan,Male,Playable,What's going on…?
Ethan,Male,Playable,Is someone… there? It's…cold… H-H-How d-did I get here? God… it's freezing… Shit… my body…
Zoe,Female,Non-Playable,You're so dumb.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Eveline? How are you here!?
Eveline,Female,Non-Playable,You're dead.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Dead? I mean, Miranda, she—No, I still have to save Rose."
Eveline,Female,Non-Playable,"Wrong. It wasn't Miranda, you were always dead."
Ethan,Male,Playable,What are you saying? I can still…
Eveline,Female,Non-Playable,See? Miranda didn't kill you. You mean you didn't think it was weird. No matter how much you got hurt? Remember?
Eveline,Female,Non-Playable,"Three years ago, the Baker house. You were murdered by Jack. You died there, three years ago."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Th-That's impossible… No way…
Eveline,Female,Non-Playable,You shouldn't even be able to walk around.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Quit messing with my head!
Eveline,Female,Non-Playable,ou. Shouldn't. Be. Walking.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Screw you! Then what am I? I…I did all that…
Ethan,Male,Playable,Rose… Mia… I…
Eveline,Female,Non-Playable,Now do you get it? Your whole body is nothing but mold! You can't ever see your family again.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Family? F-Family? No! Rose! I have to… save… my daughter!
Eveline,Female,Non-Playable,You're already dead… dead!
Ethan,Male,Playable,I… will… save… Rose!
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"At last, he awakes!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Where am I?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"My carriage, Ethan. You were having a nightmare."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Duke?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Your battle with Heisenberg was a sight to see, but to think Miranda would show herself…"
Ethan,Male,Playable,How long have I been out?
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Not long 'till dawn.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Duke, I need a favor. Take me to Miranda."
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,I assumed as much and am already on the way. We should arrive shortly.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Thank you.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"But, Ethan, are you sure of this? Your body is, well, falling apart."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Yes.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Foolish of me to ask.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Speaking of foolish questions, who-what are you?"
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,Even I can't quite answer that! We're here.
Ethan,Male,Playable,I owe you one.
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Mister Winters, I'm afraid you can't return to your old world any longer… Are you ready?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Yeah. I have to be.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Ugh… I gotta go!
Duke,Male,Non-Playable,"Duke's Emporium has everything you need for your decisive battle. Oho, the assemblage of life and machine! I can feel Lord Heisenberg's essence through it. Amat victoria curam. Please, be well."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Thanks.
Ethan,Male,Playable,I gotta keep… going…
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"Ah, little Eva! My beautiful daughter! Come to me."
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"Eva, is that you? Oh how I've missed you. —What?"
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,My power is leaving me!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Rose! Miranda!
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"Interesting, your body certainly isn't normal."
Ethan,Male,Playable,Give Rose to me! Now!
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"You will see. Once I kill you properly, every—"
Chris,Male,Playable,Get her! Now!
Ethan,Male,Playable,Let go!
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,I've spent a lifetime creating this moment… …and you try to take it away from me? I will take what is due. My desires will be fulfilled!
Ethan,Male,Playable,No!
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,Rose is mine!
Ethan,Male,Playable,What the fuck!?
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"You've fulfilled your purpose, Mr. Winters. You disposed of my false children and awakened the glorious Megamycete. Now, please do not worry for little Rose. I assure you I'll provide her with true happiness. So now you can die peacefully… and permanently."
Ethan,Male,Playable,I’m not letting you get away…
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"You understand the love of a parent to her child, don't you? How can you deny me?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Why the hell can't you realize Rose is my goddamn kid, not yours?"
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,Your time is up! Now die! I shall put you to rest! The Megamycete saved me from the pits of despair! It granted me this splendid power!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Yeah, right. All it's done is drive you nuts."
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"After all, everyone dies eventually. O great Megamycete, hear my prayer! None shall interfere in my grand designs! If I combine Rose with the Megamycete, my daughter will be made manifest at last! I've waited a century! A century! All for this day! For my daughter! Die… Why do you interfere? Surely you have no need of Rose now, so close to death?"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"She's my goddamn daughter, you psycho!"
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"Here I come! Such vitality… how disgusting. Will this kill you? Die! This is the end. Cease this foolishness! The villagers, these four new children… They could do nothing to assuage my years of loneliness!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Ever think the problem might be you, Miranda? You're not capable of real love!"
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,"This is how you end, Ethan Winters! To ensure I never see your face again, I will feed you to the Megamycete. Every single cell of your being."
Miranda,Female,Non-Playable,My daughter… My Eva!
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Rose! Shhh-Shhh. It-it's all right, Rose. It's all right."
Chris,Male,Playable,"Ethan! Ethan! Come on, Ethan. Come on, Ethan, wake up!"
Chris,Male,Playable,Oh no.
Ethan,Male,Playable,Chris…
Chris,Male,Playable,"Ethan, you did it! It's finished."
Ethan,Male,Playable,I think we finished each other…
Chris,Male,Playable,"Ethan, we've gotta move."
Chris,Male,Playable,"Keep moving, Ethan! There's a bomb in that thing that'll blow this whole village sky-high! Look at me! When I hit this trigger, we can't be anywhere near it! Dammit, Mia's waiting for you! She's alive, you hear me? Alive!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Mia…? I'm so sorry… I love you… Keep Rose safe.
Chris,Male,Playable,"Hey, hey! Hey… You tell her yourself. Now come on, it's not that much further!"
Ethan,Male,Playable,Watch over her. Teach her to be strong…
Chris,Male,Playable,Goddammit.
Ethan,Male,Playable,"Goodbye, Rosemary."
Chris,Male,Playable,Ethan…
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,Rose!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Go. Go! Take us up, now!"
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,Wait! Where's Ethan!?
Chris,Male,Playable,Get moving. We have to get clear.
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,No. We can't go! Not without my husband!
Chris,Male,Playable,"Mia, sit down and strap in."
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,Not before you tell me where Ethan is. I know he wouldn't abandon us! Tell me what's going on! Where—
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,What was that?
Chris,Male,Playable,I told you to sit down.
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,No… Where is he? Chris? What have you done—?
Chris,Male,Playable,He’s gone! I tried! He stayed so we could all escape. I'm sorry…
Pilot,,Non-Playable,"Captain, you need to see this. BSAA didn't send soldiers… This is a bioweapon."
Chris,Male,Playable,What the hell were they thinking?
Pilot,,Non-Playable,"Orders, Captain?"
Chris,Male,Playable,Pick up the rest of the squad. Plot a course for BSAA Europe HQ. Someone's gotta pay.
Mia,Female,Non-Playable,"Gifts we gave, but more you took, she snarled. So more, in turn, is due. In a blink the girl was trapped inside a mirror. Her parents, though, had searched all day and, at last, arrived. With rampant rage, Father fought the Witch while Mother's loving touch shattered the dark enchantment. But the Witch was strong and Father yelled, Save our daughter! So Mother bore their child to safety as the forest was consumed. Even now, the burnt forest is a grim reminder of Father's sacrifice. To this day, any child who stares too long into the charred wasteland will be haunted by nightmares of getting lost while picking berries."
Mom,Female,Non-Playable,Do you think the boy will be able to touch the moon?
Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,Nobody can touch the moon. It's too far away.
Mom,Female,Non-Playable,"Wait, what if he has a rocket ship?"
Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,"OK, then you could touch it. But it would be very, very cold."
Mom,Female,Non-Playable,You were being silly. I don't think the moon feels like a killer whale.
Daughter,Female,Non-Playable,"I think it does, but—"
Zoe,Female,Non-Playable,Hey Dad. Happy birthday.
Zoe,Female,Non-Playable,Sorry I missed last week. I have a lot of tests coming up. You know how it is.
Zoe,Female,Non-Playable,Talk of the goddamn devil. Duty calls. I love you.
Man In Black,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, I found her… Where else? Today of all days. We have a situation. You're needed… Eveline."
Zoe,Female,Non-Playable,Don't you ever call me that again.
Man In Black,Male,Non-Playable,"Whoa, whoa. It's just a joke, Rose."
Zoe,Female,Non-Playable,I can show you things even Chris doesn't know I can do.
Man,Male,Non-Playable,We have a clear shot.
Man In Black,Male,Non-Playable,Stand down. I can handle it. She's just a kid.
Rose,Female,Non-Playable,"Way to keep it together, Rose."
Man In Black,Male,Non-Playable,"You're a lot like him, you know?"
Rose,Female,Non-Playable,I know.
