Mia,Female,"Hey baby! I just wanted to send a quick hello and I love you. I'm gonna be coming home soon! Yay! I cannot wait to be done with this babysitting job... and come home to my loving husband. I miss you. I gotta get back to work. I love you, Ethan. I miss you so much. I'm sending tons of kisses. Bye baby!"
Mia,Female,"Ethan… You were right. I did lie to you. I shouldn't have, but... All I can say is that if you get this... Stay away."
Ethan,Male,"Hey, it's, uh… it's Ethan."
Ethan,Male,"Yeah, yeah. No, I'm good, I'm good. It's Mia. She's not dead, she's alive. She's back."
Ethan,Male,"I don't know. I don't know how, but she's back, she's back somehow. Maybe it's a prank. She wants me to come and get her."
Ethan,Male,"Dulvey. Dulvey, Louisiana."
Ethan,Male,"I know, I know. But what if it is her? I have to find out what happened."
Ethan,Male,This is the place.
Ethan,Male,Damn!
Pete,Male,Boo! Where did you find this guy?
Andre,Male,"Give me a break, Pete."
Pete,Male,"Hey! I only work with professionals. Speaking of which, make sure the sound is right this time. I don't want a repeat of Amarillo."
Andre,Male,That was two fucking years ago.
Pete,Male,I don't do ADR. This new guy? I'm not feeling it.
Andre,Male,Again?
Pete,Male,"Just don't be surprised if we have to make change. New plan. We do a walkthrough of the inside first, shoot the intro."
Andre,Male,"Just like we always do. Just try to say the show's name this time, OK?"
Pete,Male,"No problem. “Tonight on Sewer Gators, another worthless fucking shithole.” Happy?"
Andre,Male,Ecstatic.
Pete,Male,"Are we rolling? Alright, let's go."
Andre,Male,Get outta the way.
Pete,Male,It's locked.
Andre,Male,"After you. So, why are we in hell this time? Do you ever prep?"
Pete,Male,"What's to prep? Shitty house. Spooky sounds. Ooh, is it haunted? Fuck me. I was an anchor, you know."
Andre,Male,"Weekend sub, Pete. Not anchor."
Pete,Male,What's that?
Andre,Male,Nothing.
Pete,Male,"What's the story, Andre?"
Andre,Male,Abandoned farm house. Missing family. The usual.
Pete,Male,How long did you say this place had been abandoned?
Andre,Male,Three years.
Pete,Male,"Clancy, get a shot of this. This'd make a great cutaway. So, uh, Hillbilly Joe and his family go missing..."
Andre,Male,"Not hillbillies. The Bakers. Jack and Marguerite Baker. And they were quiet, not backward. Lot of bad rumors about their son, Lucas. Bad seed, apparently."
Pete,Male,"Ah, shit! I knew I shouldn't have worn my good shoes. Oh, shit. Glad I had my shots. Although, this'd make a great backdrop. Andre, what do you think? Andre. Andre! Clancy, you see where Andre went? Where is he? Un-fucking-believable. This is the last time I work with that guy. I mean producers, they come and go, but a good cameraman like you, Clancy? You stick with me."
Pete,Male,"What the fuck was that? Did you hear that? Andre? Where the fuck is he? Andre, where are you, man?"
Pete,Male,"What the hell? You gotta be fucking kidding me. Alright, new deal. W-We find Andre and we go. I mean, fuck this show."
Pete,Male,"You first. Need a nice hero shot of me coming down the ladder. So, uh, you first."
Pete,Male,What do you see? What is it?
Ethan,Male,Looks like the owners.
Ethan,Male,Mia! Thank god I found you. It's me. It's Ethan!
Mia,Female,Ethan? Ethan!
Ethan,Male,Are you alright?
Mia,Female,You shouldn't be here.
Ethan,Male,What do you mean? You contacted me.
Mia,Female,"No, no, I wouldn't. Did I? Did anyone see you? Did he see you?"
Ethan,Male,He? Who else is here? What's going on?
Mia,Female,Daddy's coming. We need to go.
Ethan,Male,Daddy?
Mia,Female,We need to go… now!
Ethan,Male,Where are you taking me?
Mia,Female,Someplace safe.
Ethan,Male,Are you gonna tell me what's going on? You've been gone for three years.
Mia,Female,Three years? Has it really been three years?
Ethan,Male,What is this place? What did they do to you?
Mia,Female,Not now. We need to get out of here first. I think it's this way.
Ethan,Male,"Mia, we have to talk. That message you sent me..."
Mia,Female,Not me. That wasn't me!
Ethan,Male,But you did!
Mia,Female,I didn’t!
Ethan,Male,"OK, fine. Just tell me what's going on."
Mia,Female,I am telling you everything that I know. We have to go this way.
Ethan,Male,"Mia, are you sure you know where you're going?"
Mia,Female,The family used to bring me food through here. I remember. There. It's there! I remember this room. This is it. There's another door here. I'm sure of it. It's not here. It's gone. It's gone! We're going to be a family… now that you're here. There's another door here. I'm sure of it.
Ethan,Male,Mia…
Mia,Female,We got to get out of here.
Ethan,Male,"Just stay here, alright? I'm gonna have a look around."
Mia,Female,Leave me alone!
Ethan,Male,Mia.
Ethan,Male,"Mia, wait. Wait!"
Mia,Female,I can hear her… I can feel her clawing her way back inside of me. Get out! Leave me alone! I've been bad. I deserve this.
Ethan,Male,"What the fuck are you, Mia?"
Mia,Female,Leave me! Go!
Woman,Female,You really shouldn't have come here.
Ethan,Male,Who's this? And what the fuck is going on?
Woman,Female,My name's Zoe. There should be a way out through the attic. Go there... now.
Ethan,Male,Mia?
Mia,Female,"Ethan! It's OK. It's OK, it's me. I know you didn't mean to hurt me. But you shouldn't have done that! It fucking hurt!"
Mia,Female,Now let's see what you feel.
Mia,Female,It's my job... must... contain... outbreak! I promise... must burn it all down!
Ethan,Male,"OK, fine."
Mia,Female,"I don't want your help! You were always watching me! Why? What are you hiding, Ethan? What don't you want me to know? Forget about me! They're relying on me. Everyone is relying on me. Everyone! I love you."
Jack Baker,Male,"Welcome to the family, son."
Zoe,Female,"Come on… don't you die on us, now. You have work to do."
Ethan,Male,Where am I? What the hell?
Mother Of The Family,Female,"Rise and shine, sleepyhead. It’s time for supper."
Ethan,Male,Who are all you people? Where’s Mia?
Mother Of The Family,Female,Eat it. It's good.
Son Of The Family,Male,Dumb son of a bitch wouldn't know good if it hit him!
Mother Of The Family,Female,Lucas!
Son Of The Family,Male,"Goddamn, old man, not again!"
Jack Baker,Male,"Get out the way, Marguerite! That boy's got to eat! He got to have his supper. Come here, boy. Let's do this, come on."
Mother Of The Family,Female,"Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit—he's not eating it. Jack!"
Jack Baker,Male,"Shut the hell up, Marguerite!"
Mother Of The Family,Female,I made that for him!
Jack Baker,Male,Get the hell outta here!
Mother Of The Family,Female,You're a son of a bitch!
Jack Baker,Male,"This was supposed to be a very special feast. Come here, boy. Come on now."
Son Of The Family,Male,God damn it. I bet it's that cop again.
Jack Baker,Male,Goddamn pigs! I'm coming back for you.
Jack Baker,Male,"Where'd that little shit get to? You know what they say… once family, always family. Thought you'd just slip out before dinner was done? God damn it, how I am gonna replace this? You came to the wrong house, boy."
Ethan,Male,What the fuck!
Jack Baker,Male,You… better… run… Here's daddy! Stay right there. You're wasting your time. I'm on to you.
Jack Baker,Male,"Alright, have fun under there, boy. I'm gonna come back for you later."
Zoe,Female,You did good. Ethan.
Ethan,Male,"Zoe, right? What the fuck are these…"
Zoe,Female,Shut up and listen if you want to stay alive. You gotta get out of that house. There might be a way out through the main hall. And that thing on your wrist is a codex. Don't lose it. It's important.
Ethan,Male,Hell-of-a-girl.
Police Officer,,"Open up! Hey, over here!"
Ethan,Male,"Hey, you gotta help me!"
Police Officer,,"Hold on, back up! Now, sir, do you we here? I mean, is this your property?"
Ethan,Male,What? Me? No. No!
Police Officer,,Alright. Now we got several calls about some missing persons lately.
Ethan,Male,You don't understand. I gotta get outta here!
Police Officer,,Now calm down.
Ethan,Male,You're not listening to me. There are crazy people in this house trying fucking kill me!
Police Officer,,"Well alright, lemme tell you this. You don't exactly seem like you're playing with a full deck yourself, alright?"
Ethan,Male,Are you kidding me?
Police Officer,,"Look, like I said, we've had several missing persons calls, and I can't rule out that an outsider like yourself may not be involved."
Ethan,Male,Alright. I'll tell you whatever you want.
Police Officer,,"Alright. Now that's more like it. Now, meet me in the garage. We'll talk there."
Ethan,Male,"Hey, wait! You gotta give me your gun!"
Police Officer,,You must have lost your mind.
Ethan,Male,"Look, officer. Now do you wanna see my name in the obituaries? Or do you wanna be a hero and save my life? A fucking pocket knife?"
Police Officer,,Here. Take it! That's all you’re gonna get. Now go. Garage. Now.
Ethan,Male,What am I gonna do with a knife?
Ethan,Male,Hey! We gotta get the fuck outta here.
Police Officer,,Now first you need to tell me what you're doing here alone in the middle of the night?
Ethan,Male,Me? What about you?
Police Officer,,"Now, it's my job. Why don't you do your job and tell me? Answer my questions."
Ethan,Male,You're not gonna believe me if I told you.
Police Officer,,Try me. Hey. Put that door back up. Put that door back up! What are you doing?
Ethan,Male,Wait! Wait!
Ethan,Male,Fuck it. I'm gonna kill every one of you.
Jack Baker,Male,"Motherfuck! Ho-ho! Alright, bring it on! Where'd you learn to drive? Let's finish this… you and I. Aww yeah, I'm gonna take you for a ride!"
Ethan,Male,No… no!! Fuuuck!
Jack Baker,Male,"Oh boy, now look what you've done, motherfucker!"
Jack Baker,Male,"Do I have your attention, boy? You are about to see something wonderful. Shoot me! Shoot me!"
Ethan,Male,Fuck!
Zoe,Female,Did my daddy give you a hard time?
Ethan,Male,That's your father?
Zoe,Female,He used to be.
Ethan,Male,"I'm sorry… but he's, uh, he's dead now."
Zoe,Female,You just might be able to pull this off.
Ethan,Male,What? Pull what off?
Zoe,Female,There's something I need you to do. I can't explain it right now. I’ll be in touch.
Mia,Female,"Ethan, if you find this... I know I can't expect anything from you. Not after what happened. After what I did. But I just want you to know that wasn't me. I don't know what happened. There's so much that you need to know."
Mother Of The Family,Female,"You gave us quite a scare, young lady!"
Mia,Female,I can't let her catch me again.
Young Girl,Female,"Over here, mommy."
Mother Of The Family,Female,"I am sick and tired over being sick and tired of your bullshit, girl."
Mia,Female,I need to hide... I need to hide...
Mother Of The Family,Female,"Why are you putting me through this? What have I done to deserve this except open my home and feed you? I don't understand you at all. This is a gift. This house… this house has seen more than you imagine, and it knows. Now's not the time for that. You just don't understand or is it that you just don't care? I know you and Zoe are plotting. I know you are scheming. You think I don't know what you want to do with that boy Ethan?"
Mia,Female,"No… no no, don't come over here."
Mother Of The Family,Female,"I'll feed you to my babies and fertilize the garden with what was left. We open our home! We open our hearts! And what do you do?! She loves you. She wants us to be a family, god damn it. You… you! All you have to do is accept her fucking gift! We love you... Why can't you see that?! Don't move! No, no, no, no, no—you don't fuckin' try to escape your share of the blame. There's no way out of there, missy. Looks like it's a part of something."
Mother Of The Family,Female,Where do you think you're going?
Mia,Female,"Ethan! Ethan, please help me! Help, Ethan! No!"
Ethan,Male,"What did they do to you, Mia?"
Jack Baker,Male,"Heck of a thing, ain't it? Sure as shit beats the hell out of dying. My little girl has given us a gift, and this gift is with me always. As you can see, the family is only a part of her gift. Which – in a word – means, you're fucked. Come out, come out wherever you are."
Ethan,Male,Who builds this shit?
Ethan,Male,What the– ?
Jack Baker,Male,It won't be long before I find you and kill you. Here I come.
Jack Baker,Male,"No way out, ya know!"
Jack Baker,Male,This is all too fun.
Jack Baker,Male,I was gonna be her father. But now she says he will be her father. No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. I will find him and I will make him suffer. And you my friend will help me.
Ethan,Male,Poor deputy...
Jack Baker,Male,Groovy.
Jack Baker,Male,"That'a boy, that's the ticket! You are gonna get it now! Fun, ain't it? Ugh! That's it! What's the matter? Outta juice?"
Ethan,Male,Do me a favor and stay dead.
Zoe,Female,You made it. You're the first I've ever seen make it this far.
Ethan,Male,"So, what is it you need me to do? Is it gonna help me get outta here?"
Zoe,Female,"Yes, now listen carefully, Ethan. My family and I… our bodies are contaminated. I can't leave the property unless I get it out. Same goes for Mia."
Ethan,Male,Is there a way to get it out?
Zoe,Female,We need the serum. It should clear whatever this stuff is out of the body. As long as you're not too far gone.
Ethan,Male,"Alright, so where is it?"
Zoe,Female,If I knew where one was I'd already be long gone. But I have a feeling my mother has hidden some inside the old house somewhere.
Ethan,Male,"So if we get this thing, I can help Mia and we can get outta here?"
Zoe,Female,"Right, and so can I. The old house is near the water – you can't miss it. I just hope you can handle my mother. Be careful. They'll be lookin for ya."
Mia,Female,Ethan.
Ethan,Male,"No more bullshit, Mia. I want some answers."
Mia,Female,"I know. I know. You're right. And I always wanted to tell you – but, I just – I can only remember a little and…"
Son Of The Family,Male,"Daddy, right? You mind if I borrow Mommy for a little bit? Well don't just stand there – do something!"
Mia,Female,Ethan! Help!
Ethan,Male,Dammit–
Mother Of The Family,Female,"Aha! ...Damn. Yes, my kiddies! Alright, you piece of shit – I've had about enough of you. I told you to get out! It's mine. Watch this you troublesome piece of shit!"
Ethan,Male,"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Jesus – fuck."
Mother Of The Family,Female,I told you to stay out of here.
Mother Of The Family,Female,"Alright, you little cocksucker, let's get down to business."
Mother Of The Family,Female,"Not nice, cher. This is beyond the pale, you hear me?"
Mother Of The Family,Female,It s mine... It's mine... My light...
Ethan,Male,I think that's it.
Zoe,Female,Well? Did you find a serum?
Ethan,Male,I just got done dealing with your mom and her fucking bugs. I wish you coulda warned me.
Zoe,Female,Sorry about that. What about the serum?
Ethan,Male,"Haven't found any, but I did find out what we need to make one. A D-series head and an arm. This can't be right..."
Zoe,Female,A head? I think I have that around here somewhere.
Ethan,Male,You do??
Zoe,Female,"I don't know about the arm, though. Have you searched the whole house?"
Ethan,Male,"No, not yet. I still need to check the second floor here."
Zoe,Female,"Alright, check it out. Meet me at the trailer if you find it."
Ethan,Male,What the fuck? That's special.
Mother Of The Family,Female,"Gotcha! Now what do you think you are doing? I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna kill you!"
Ethan,Male,Just fucking stay dead – OK?
Daughter Of The Family,Female,Stay away.
Ethan,Male,"Ugh, god. I guess this is it."
Zoe,Female,Did you find it?
Ethan,Male,"Yeah, I got it. Are we really gonna be able to make a serum with this thing?"
Zoe,Female,"It'll be fine. After we make it, we can get out of here – together. I'll be waiting for you in the trailer."
Ethan,Male,Now where the hell are you? Never mind. We only need the head and you've got it. And this is gonna help Mia and me right?
Son Of The Family,Male,"Hey, buddy! I thought you should know. I decided Zoe needed a time out She and Mia are here with me. They're keeping each other company."
Ethan,Male,Just let them both go. What do you need them for?
Son Of The Family,Male,"That's family business, Ethan, and not your concern understand? Now, if you want the head, feel free to come on by anytime, I’ll give it to ya! But only if you participate in a little... activity I've put together just for you."
Ethan,Male,What activity?
Son Of The Family,Male,"Oh, know you're excited, but don’t worry. It’s not going anywhere. First step I need you to take, partner, is for you to take a peek inside the fridge in the trailer there."
Ethan,Male,Fuck you.
Son Of The Family,Male,"Oh, come on now, don't be like that. You wanna have some fun, don't ya? Now, look in the fridge!"
Ethan,Male,Rigor mortis must have set in. His joints are already stiff.
Ethan,Male,There’s a sickeningly sweet stench. He’s started rotting already.
Son Of The Family,Male,"That pretty little thing will help you find the two keycards you're gonna need to join the party we're havin' in here. You gotta earn your way, Ethan!"
Ethan,Male,Oh my god.
Son Of The Family,Male,"Hey buddy! Remember, those two key cards will get you into the party. Don't be late now!"
Ethan,Male,Let me talk to Mia!
Son Of The Family,Male,"No, no, no! You gotta show up first! You haven't forgotten where the party is, have you? You can get in from the courtyard. So come on, man! Everybody's waitin' for ya!"
Experiment,,Can trespassing idiots solve puzzles?
Son Of The Family,Male,"You, my friend, you are one lucky son of a bitch. You know, I actually envy you. What? You don't believe me? This joy? Why you can't fake this. It has taken me weeks to finish this, and it is finally ready. And it's all for you. Aw, come on now. Don't be like that. This is going to be fun. Just you wait."
Son Of The Family,Male,"I'm calling the game, “I'd really like to make it out of this room alive and not die a horrible painful death.” I know, it’s temp title. Take a candle, light it, and put it on the cake. And remember to smile. This party is for you!"
Clancy,,Fuck you.
Clancy,,Fucking disgusting... this is gross.
Clancy,,What the fuck is this? What are you doing?
Clancy,,Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Oh man! Fuck! Fuck!
Son Of The Family,Male,Happy birthday.
Son Of The Family,Male,"Ethan. E-than. Ethan, Ethan – hold on, hold on, hold on. I got something for you. Looky, looky what I got. You now what this is for? You know what Zoe wants to do with this? She’s thing is special. No, Ethan, that ain’t special. This – this right here is special. You see, Ethan, not everybody wants to turn back the clock. What? What, Eveline? I'm just trying to show him. I'm just trying to show him that not everybody wants to go back to how things were. Zoe’s a stupid bitch! She doesn't understand that I don't wanna go back to how things were before my father found y'all. Not everybody wants to turn back the clock. So – so, Ethan. Ethan? You can, uh – you can, um, crawl around underneath that filthy, rotten house all you want looking for them ingredients, but you ain't gonna find a goddamn thing, Ethan. You wanna make that serum? Ooh, baby. You're gonna have to come through me. You hear? Well, come on, Ethan. What do you say?"
Ethan,Male,Fuck.
Son Of The Family,Male,"Ooo, you’ve got a good eye. What do you got against crates, Ethan? Careful, now – they bite back. Guess I'm gonna have to step up my game."
Son Of The Family,Male,"I know – fucking passwords, right? Why don't you try 0814. No-no-no-no-no! 0621. No-no-no-no-no! It's 0514. Well, come on. Take a chance. You never know. Tick tock, tick tock."
Son Of The Family,Male,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the barn fight! Keep it clean, gentlemen – we have rules."
Ethan,Male,Fuck you too.
Son Of The Family,Male,"It's how you deal with hardships in life that makes you a man, Ethan! Oh, damn, that's gotta smart. Got to say, I'm impressed. Not only are you still alive, you have all your fingers and toes."
Son Of The Family,Male,"Fat man down, fat man down. Meh – he was never my favorite anyways."
Son Of The Family,Male,"Have a nice day. Alright, what do you say we play a little game? All you gotta do is light the candle and put it on the cake."
Ethan,Male,Kiss my ass.
Son Of The Family,Male,"Ethan, language. There are children in the building – somewhere – I think. I’m not sure anymore."
Son Of The Family,Male,"Motherfucker! You're supposed to die! That was supposed to be for you, god damn it!"
Ethan,Male,Mia? Mia. Mia!
Zoe,Female,She's alive.
Ethan,Male,Who are you? Where are you?
Zoe,Female,We're just beyond the pier outside that room – hurry!
Son Of The Family,Male,"Well now, Ethan!"
Ethan,Male,The fuck do you want?
Son Of The Family,Male,You... dead! Guess that's not in the cards. Not yet.
Ethan,Male,"Lucky me. Look, unless you have any more surprises up your sleeve, I suggest you–"
Son Of The Family,Male,"Now that would be tellin', Ethan. And I don't do spoilers."
Ethan,Male,Dick.
Ethan,Male,"Finally– I'm coming, Mia."
Ethan,Male,"Zoe? Zoe, I–"
Zoe,Female,Not now. We don't have the time. Do you have both ingredients?
Ethan,Male,"Right here. This should be enough, right?"
Zoe,Female,If we make 'em fast enough. My father and Lucas aren't far away.
Mia,Female,He's coming. Daddy's coming.
Zoe,Female,"Good, there's enough for two."
Ethan,Male,"So, after we make the serum, what's next?"
Zoe,Female,There's a boat outside. We'll take it through the swamp. But neither of us'll get very far without the serum.
Zoe,Female,Hey! One of those is mine.
Monster,,"Zoe! Get your ass back to the house. I will deal with you later. It's bad enough you take my new daughter from me. Now, you're plotting against me – with my own blood?!"
Ethan,Male,"This is getting old, Jack!"
Jack Baker,Male,Cut it out! Hungry! I'm going to kill you. Then Mia. You're not getting out of here. No one loves me. You'll choke on your blood before I'm done with you. You and that bitch Mia. Poor thing. Idiot – you can't kill me. Shitcock! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! You're going to wish you'd had the good sense to lay down and die. I'm-gonna get ya! I'm gonna get ya! Fuck you. I can't die. But you can. You're part of the family now. I was gonna be her father. Hold still! I'm going to enjoy watching you die. Don't be scared.
Ethan,Male,Now I've seen everything.
Zoe,Female,Ethan! This way.
Jack Baker,Male,"Not leaving, are you?"
Zoe,Female,Use the serum on him!
Ethan,Male,You want me to cure him?!
Zoe,Female,Are you alright?
Ethan,Male,Yeah.
Zoe,Female,Come on. Mia's waiting for us.
Ethan,Male,I had to use one of them. There's only one left.
Mia,Female,There's only one left? There can't just be one left.
Zoe,Female,What the hell are we gonna do now?
Zoe,Female,Its fine. It was foolish thinking I could escape.
Mia,Female,But Zoe–
Zoe,Female,Go. Both of you just go!
Mia,Female,Come with us. I'm sure there's someone who can help–
Zoe,Female,"This is my home. Apparently, I belong here."
Ethan,Male,I’ll send help.
Zoe,Female,Don't bother! There won't be anyone left to help.
Mia,Female,"Ethan, thank you."
Ethan,Male,Who the hell else was I going to choose?
Mia,Female,Ethan!
Ethan,Male,"Mia, I know you've been through a lot. But we need to talk. You had something to do with all of this, didn't you? Look, I just wanna know the truth."
Mia,Female,"Ethan, I honestly don't remember."
Ethan,Male,Try. Is that the boat? How the fuck did that get here?
Ethan,Male,You're OK. What the hell was that? What the fuck? What is that? What is that?
Eveline,Female,Mommy. This way.
Mia,Female,How? Ethan! Ethan? Ethan!
Mia,Female,What was that?
Mia,Female,He must have been hiding from something.
Eveline,Female,Are you remembering?
Mia,Female,What? What are you?
Eveline,Female,You said we could be a family.
Mia,Female,What are you talking about?
Eveline,Female,You said!
Mia,Female,Wait! Please!
Eveline,Female,I'm tired of waiting.
Eveline,Female,Watch it.
Mia,Female,What? Why?
Eveline,Female,You need to remember – so we can be a family.
Mia,Female,"Alan, you're getting worse."
Alan,Male,She must have infected me during the attack. And I'm too far gone anyway. But it serves me right. It's my fault she got out.
Mia,Female,"Yeah, it is your fault. But that doesn't mean I'm gonna let you die."
Alan,Male,She didn't attack you?
Mia,Female,It's part of her imprinting protocol. I can't believe this is happening.
Alan,Male,"Here, take it. It has her tissue samples. You find her – you fix this."
Mia,Female,"OK, Evie. Where are you?"
Mia,Female,She's close.
Mia,Female,"She's vomiting… Damn, I'll have to reset."
Alan,Male,How's it going?
Mia,Female,She's vomiting. Far more in excess of her body mass.
Alan,Male,"Oh great. We're gonna be seeing a lot more of her ugly friends if this keeps up. Alright, we need to find her and fast. This is getting out of hand."
Mia,Female,"Alan. I think she's on the other side of this door, but I don’t have a key."
Alan,Male,"Try to melt down the lock. You're on the bottom level, right? Check our luggage."
Eveline,Female,"Are you mad at me, mommy?"
Mia,Female,"Evie, I'm not mad. Wait, what did you call me?"
Eveline,Female,I don't want to live at the lab anymore. I want a house. And I want you to be my mommy.
Mia,Female,"OK, Evie, I'll be your mommy. Just come back with me right now, OK? Where are you, Evie? Evie, wait!"
Alan,Male,Did you find her?
Mia,Female,"Yes, but she ran off. She's making more friends, Alan. Those things are everywhere."
Alan,Male,I told you so.
Mia,Female,Are you OK?
Alan,Male,You just worry about getting Eveline back.
Warning System,,Emergency Safety Lockdown system has been engaged.
Mia,Female,"Alan? Alan, where the hell are you?"
Mia,Female,How did you get here?
Alan,Male,Where's Evie?
Mia,Female,She's out of control. Without the treatments she's deteriorating.
Alan,Male,"Well, it's a good thing I'm already dying."
Mia,Female,Don't say that.
Alan,Male,"She trusts you. That little bitch, she never– I didn't mean to call you that, Evie."
Mia,Female,She's trying to take control. You have to fight her.
Mia,Female,"Eveline, stop! Stop right now!"
Alan,Male,Don't touch me!
Mia,Female,"Ethan. You were right. I did lie to you. I shouldn't have, but... All I can say is that if you get this... Stay away. Forget that you ever knew me. Have a good life."
Eveline,Female,We'll be together forever.
Eveline,Female,Now do you remember?
Mia,Female,"Yes, Eveline, I remember."
Eveline,Female,Can we be a family like before?
Mia,Female,"No, Evie. We can't be a family. We were never a family. We will never be a family."
Eveline,Female,Then I don't need you anymore.
Mia,Female,"Maybe it still works. Ethan– I hope I make it in time. OK, bottom level."
Eveline,Female,Liar.
Mia,Female,"Stop it, Eveline! Fucking hallucinations. Where is she?"
Mia,Female,Ethan.
Eveline,Female,He's waiting.
Eveline,Female,I need you to do something for me.
Jack Baker,Male,"Ethan. Ethan. I know, I know. I know – I'm not going to hurt you. Hell, I never would have if I could have helped it."
Ethan,Male,What do you mean?
Jack Baker,Male,"I'm no killer, son. Neither is Marguerite, nor my boy Lucas. Or even Zoe here. That girl, Eveline, she did this."
Ethan,Male,What the hell is she? Now that did she do to you?
Jack Baker,Male,She infected us with her gift. That's what she calls it. I found her near a busted-out tanker in the bayou. Everything changed after that.
Ethan,Male,"So she infects you, and then she takes control?"
Jack Baker,Male,"No, not exactly, son. She just – she forces her way into your mind and your soul and… you can't fight back. You are connected to her and you can't resist the urge to… You're a different person after that."
Ethan,Male,So Mia sent me that message because of Eveline.
Jack Baker,Male,"Listen, the girl just wants a family of her own. She's the key, alright? You find her and you stop her. Ethan free my family – please."
Mia,Female,"Eveline, stay away from him."
Eveline,Female,Why? He doesn't love you. I can make him love you.
Mia,Female,Don't – Don't hurt him.
Eveline,Female,Silly – I told you. I'm not going to hurt him.
Mia,Female,Don't you dare.
Eveline,Female,"Or, what? You're not my mommy – remember."
Ethan,Male,Mia? Mia? How?
Mia,Female,"There's no time. You have to get out of here and find her. Here, take this."
Ethan,Male,Wait–wait–what are you doing? What are you doing?
Mia,Female,Saving your life.
Mia,Female,"You need to go. I won't be able to resist for much longer. Now, go kill that little bitch."
Ethan,Male,"No-no. Mia-no! OK, you little bitch, where the fuck are you?"
Eveline,Female,Die!
Ethan,Male,Fuck!
Eveline,Female,This is your fault.
Ethan,Male,Why am I seeing this?
Eveline,Female,He doesn't want to be my Daddy? Then he can die. Now it's Mommy's turn to kill you. You're gonna be one of us. Then maybe you'll play nicely.
Ethan,Male,I'm not playing.
Eveline,Female,No! Get that away from me!
Mia,Female,Forget about me! It all has to come down. I don't want to hurt you. I don't need your pity! Contained. She must be contained.
Eveline,Female,Stay away! No you don't! No no no!
Ethan,Male,You?
Eveline,Female,Why does everyone hate me?
Ethan,Male,"Goodbye, Eveline."
Eveline,Female,It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!
Soldier,,I'm Redfield. I'm glad we found you.
Ethan,Male,The fuck took you guys so long?
Mia,Female,Ethan?
Ethan,Male,Mia– You made it. I'm glad.
Mia,Female,Did I?
Ethan,Male,"They say that when one door closes, another opens. Well, a door closed tonight. And what a long night it was–but not just for me. Mia and I weren't the only victims here. So were the Bakers. It was that… thing, Eveline, who made them that way. But now Eveline’s dead."
Ethan,Male,And these guys are here to clean up the mess. I had Just come to terms with losing Mia. But now she’s back and wants to start over– put all of this behind us. Maybe this is where the next door opens.
