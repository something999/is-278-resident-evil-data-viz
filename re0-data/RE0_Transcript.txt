***Prologue***

Narrator's Voice:

A small mid-western town in America: Raccoon City.

A solitary island far off in the sea: Rock Fort Island.

An island that would become the second Raccoon City: Sheena Island.

There are still many unanswered questions about these seemingly unrelated and 
yet intensely traumatic events.

Though it is believed that the international enterprise, Umbrella was somehow 
involved, little is known as to the origin of this faceless corporation.

When was it established?

By whom?

And how was the T-Virus created?

To uncover the truth, we must delve deeper into the events which transpired in 
the beginning before the mansion incident.

(Cut to train)

July 23, 1998
Raccoon Forest 20:17

(Various passenger voices can be heard.)

Man: "Really?"

Woman: "Hmm, do you think so too?"
Bald Man: "Yeah."

White Man: ".do about it?"
Black Man: "We should hold off for a while."
White Man: "I wonder how those RNP people will react to this?"

(Splattering sounds heard.)

Man with Glasses: "Hmm?"

(Cut to man standing on a cliff overlooking the train)

(The man is singing.)

(Cut back to train.)

(Man in glasses peers out the window, soon dozens of leeches latch onto the 
window.)

Man with Glasses: (gasps)

(More leeches follow, until the window is covered with them.)

Man with Glasses: (screams and leaps from his seat.)

(Leeches fall from the ceiling latching onto the passengers as they panic and 
scream.  The man on the cliff finishes his songs after the attack has ended.)

(Cut to S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team helicopter.)

2 hours later
Above Raccoon Forest

Rebecca's Voice:

It began as a simple investigation of some bizarre murders in the suburbs of 
Raccoon City.

Nothing in our training could ever have prepared us for the nightmare that 
ensued. 

We never stood a chance.

(Explosion in the helicopter's engine.)

Enrico: What's going on?

Edward: Engine failure!  Emergency landing!

(The helicopter rapidly descends into the forest banging against the trees)

Edward: Ugh!!

(The helicopter lands roughly, but in one piece. Bravo Team exits the chopper, 
Rebecca taking a moment to flash a "thumbs up" to Kevin who sends a quick salute 
before the door slams shut.)

Enrico: "Check the current position and investigate the surrounding area."

Rebecca: (gasps) Captain! Look!

(Cut to overturned MP vehicle)

(A flashlight illuminates the truck, as the light pans over some dead bodies are 
discovered.)

Rebecca: (gasps)

(Enrico peers over a dead body)

Rebecca: Captain!

Enrico: "Hmm? What happened?"

(Slime can be seen oozing down the truck as Enrico turns away and moves towards 
Rebecca. Rebecca picks up a file from an open case on the ground and reads it 
aloud.)

Rebecca: "Court order for transportation. Prisoner: Billy Coen, ex-lieutenant, 
26 years old.  Court marshaled and sentenced to death July 22. Prisoner is to be 
transferred to the Ragathon Base for execution.

(Edward takes the memo from Rebecca.)

Edward: "Those poor soldiers.  They were good men just doing their jobs and that 
scum murdered them and escaped!"

(Enrico snatches the memo from Edward.)

Enrico: "Alright everyone! Let's separate and survey the area. Our friend is 
brutal and ruthless. Keep your guard up!"

(Rebecca searches until a loud noise is heard from behind her. She turns to see 
a train sitting motionless on the tracks and begins to approach it.)

***Rebecca Searches the Train***

(Sounds of voices can be heard in the air.)

Rebecca: "This is officer Chambers from S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team. Please identify 
yourself."

(Rebecca starts walking down the aisle.)

Rebecca: "Is someone there?"

(The man in the chair comes into view to reveal that he is long been dead.)

Rebecca: (gasps)

(Rebecca notices the voices are coming from a portable radio on the floor.  As 
she bends to pick it up the man in the seat gets up and reaches for her.  
Rebecca turns to flee and sees more of the "dead" people blocking the way.)

***When the Dust Settles***

Rebecca: "What just happened?  I, I thought they were dead..?"

***Meet Lt. Coen***

(Rebecca locates a dead body at the door to the Engine Car.  The body is holding 
a key in it's hand.  As Rebecca reaches for it a man steps up behind her 
pointing a gun at her head.)

Rebecca: "Billy, Lieutenant Coen."

Billy: "So, you seem to know me.  Been fantasizing about me have you?"

Rebecca: "You're the prisoner that was being transferred for execution. You were 
with those soldiers outside."

Billy: "Oh, I see. You're with S.T.A.R.S., well, no offense, honey, but your 
kind doesn't seem to want me around. So, I'm afraid our little chat time is 
over."

(Billy holsters his weapon then turns to leave, Rebecca follows)

Rebecca: "Wait! You're under arrest!"

Billy: "No thanks, doll-face. I've already worn handcuffs."

(Billy displays the broken handcuffs on his left wrist then leaves, Rebecca 
calls after him.)

Rebecca: "I could shoot you know!"

(Rebecca exhales in frustration.  Moments later a gravely injured Edward comes 
crashing through the window.  Rebecca rushes over to him.)

***Edward's Final Moments***

Rebecca: "Edward! Are you all right? What happened?"

Edward: "It's worse than.w..we can't..y..you must be careful, Rebecca. The 
forest is full of z..zombies and..monsters."

Rebecca: "Zombies and monsters?"

Edward: "Ughh, ahhh."

(Edward dies and moments later a large beast crashes through the window.)

Rebecca: "Ahhh!"

***Cerberus Attack***

(The monster is revealed to be a large dog. The animal's flesh is rotting and 
bones are exposed.  The beast growls and starts towards Rebecca.)

(In the darkened passenger car)

***Message from the Captain***

(Rebecca receives a radio call from Enrico)

Rebecca: "This is Rebecca, over."

Enrico: "Rebecca, can you hear me? This is Enrico. What's your location? Over.

Rebecca: "Enrico! Hello? Can you read me? Please respond."

Enrico: "Rebecca, I can hear you now listen up! We've obtained detailed 
information on the fugitive from a document found in the wrecked wagon. Billy 
Coen killed as many as 23 people. Over.

Rebecca: (nervous) "23 people."

Enrico: "We've also confirmed that he was institutionalized, so keep your guard 
up. Can you hear me, Rebecca? Over. Stay alert, Rebecca. He wouldn't think twice 
about killing you.

Rebecca: "Enrico? Captain! Hello? HELLO?

***I Don't Need Your Help***

(Rebecca moves into the next car, Billy enters moments later.)

Billy: "It's gonna be dangerous from here on in.  Why don't we cooperate?

Rebecca: "Cooperate? With you?"

Billy: (annoyed) "Listen, little girl, if you haven't noticed there's some 
pretty freaked out things on this train. And I, for one, wanna get out of here. 
I don't think we stand a chance of doing it alone.

Rebecca: "You expect me to trust you? A wanted felon? I don't need your help. I 
can handle this on my own.  And don't call me little girl!"

Billy: (flips Rebecca's hair with his finger) "Ha, all right, Miss Do-It-
Yourself. What should I call you?"

Rebecca: "The name is Rebecca Chambers, but that's "Officer" Chambers to you."

Billy: (mocking) Well then, Rebecca. (Leans against the door) Why don't you go 
and try while I wait here.

(Rebecca proceeds up the stairs)

***What The.?***

(On the second floor, Rebecca spots an elderly man seated at the rear of the 
car.  From the looks of things, the man could be a survivor seeing his flesh is 
still on his body.  Rebecca approaches the man.)

Rebecca: "Umm, excuse me sir? (Shakes the man's shoulder) Sir?"

(The man's head turns to face her, then continues to turn until it rolls right 
off his head and onto the floor.)

Rebecca: (gasps)

(The man's body falls to pieces and transforms into a slime like substance.  
Leech creatures pour out of the masses of slime and gather in a mass on the 
floor.  The mass grows and separates until it attains the form of a man again.  
The creature sneers at Rebecca as it attacks.)

(After the battle)

(The man's face splits open and the leeches assault Rebecca en masse.  The slimy 
monsters flow like a wave over her body threatening to cover her whole.  Shots 
ring out as the leeches are shot off of Rebecca's body.  Rebecca slumps to the 
floor as the leeches fall from her body.  Billy approaches her cautiously.  
Leeches from the floor suddenly jump at Billy, but he reacts quickly and kills 
them easily.  The rest of the leeches retreat from the train)

Rebecca: (panting)

Billy: "Are you ok?"

Rebecca: (gives a thumbs up)

Billy: "Humph."

(A voice can be heard from outside the train singing.  In the storm the leeches 
can be seen gathering around the cloaked man.)

***We Need to Cooperate***

Billy: "Who is that guy?"

(The train suddenly jerks into life.)

Rebecca: "Unh!"

Rebecca: "What's going on? Who's controlling the train?"

Billy: "Go and check out the first engine car. 

(Rebecca runs for the stairs, but Billy calls out to her.)

Billy: "Listen! We gotta cooperate with each other from now on, you got that?"

Rebecca: "Well, I don't."

Billy: (angry) "Clue in, girl! Or maybe you like being worm bait?"

Rebecca: (angry) "All right! But you just remember I will shoot you if you try 
anything funny."

Billy: "Fine. Now take these with you."  

(Billy tosses a box of Handgun ammo to Rebecca)

Billy: "If you find anything, give me a call all right?" 

(Billy displays his radio to her.  Rebecca grasps her own radio and nods at 
Billy.)

***Rebecca/Billy Restores the Light***

(On top of the train, Rebecca/Billy locates the severed wire preventing power 
from reaching the dining car and reconnects it.  The lights flash to life in the 
car as the current from the wires is reestablished.  Suddenly, a large mass of 
slime oozes from the wires underneath and leaps out at Rebecca/Billy.)

Rebecca/Billy: "Augh!"

(Rebecca/Billy jumps back to avoid the assault and ends up falling through the 
hole into the room below. A quick check of the door shows that she/he is 
trapped.)

***Rebecca/Billy Hears Noises***

(Upon entering the large bar area of the second floor above the Conductor's 
Office a loud screech is heard from the roof above as well as large clanging 
sounds as if a large something was walking around outside.)

(On the way back through the bar, a light fixture on the ceiling suddenly falls 
to the floor and shatters into a thousand glittering pieces.  More pieces of the 
ceiling start to rain down on the floor.  Looking to the ceiling a giant claw is 
revealed poking through the metal frame of the car.  The claw is joined by 
another and then the entire ceiling comes crashing down. Now it seems that a new 
friend has come to crash the party.a giant scorpion.  The beast howls it's 
greeting and lumbers forward.)

***Rebecca/Billy Clears the Path***

(Rebecca/Billy use the tool to open the hatch of the crawlspace.)

***Release the Hounds!***

(Upon exiting the crawlspace, two infected hounds burst free from their confines 
and attack.)

***Birth***

(The eggs that line the second floor hall begin to stir, then hatch.  The 
hallway is now crawling with newborn leeches.)

***We Have Control of the Train?***

(A soldier is outside the door of the engine car speaking into a radio.)

Soldier: "This is Delta Team, this is Delta Team.  We have gained control of the 
train. Over."

(Scene cuts to a control room where two men are positioned.  One is sitting, 
with blonde hair, sunglasses, and draped in a black uniform with the word, 
S.T.A.R.S., on the back.  The other man is wearing a white lab coat and is 
deeply engrossed in the file he has before him.  The men could be no one else 
but Captain Albert Wesker of the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team and Umbrella Researcher, 
William Birkin.  Wesker leans in and speaks into the microphone.)

Wesker: "Understood."

Birkin: "This does not make any sense. How was the T-Virus leaked? And why did 
it contaminate both the lab in the mansion, as well as a train almost three 
miles away?"

(Wesker cups his hand over the mic.)

Wesker: "That's irrelevant! We must make sure no knowledge of this gets out. 
Destroy the train. Completely!

(Wesker speaks into the mic again.)

Wesker: "How far away are you from the nearest branch line?"

(Scene cuts back to the soldier on the other end of the radio. Behind the 
soldier, leeches are oozing out from behind the fence.)

Soldier: "About ten minutes to.."

(The soldier turns as he speaks and spots the leeches just before they attack.  
The creatures swarm all over his body, sinking their teeth into his body. The 
man howls in agony and fires off his machinegun in desperation. Wesker hears the 
gunfire over the radio and yells.)

Wesker: "What happened?"

(Another soldier comes out from the control room to see what's happening and is 
also covered in leeches and killed. After the men are dead, the leeches 
retreat.)

***Activate the Brakes!***

(The train's engine was damaged in the firefight from the soldiers and is 
rapidly gaining speed.  At this rate the train will jump the tracks at the 
interchange ahead.  The brakes must be activated.  Billy and Rebecca survey the 
controls of the train.)

Billy: "The train will either derail or crash. I have to stop this thing!"

(The team splits up, one member going to the rear of the train to activate the 
system and the other will remain at the controls to physically apply the brake.)

***Rebecca Volunteers to Activate the Brake***

Rebecca: "I'll go over to the back deck and manipulate the control panel for the 
brake. You stay here and apply the brake when ready."

Billy: "Ok."

(Rebecca turns to leave.)

Billy: "Rebecca!"

(Rebecca turns back to Billy.)

Rebecca: "Hmm?"

Billy: "Don't screw up, ok?"

Rebecca: (confidently placing her hand on her hip) "I won't."

***Zombie Attack***

(On the way to the rear car, Rebecca stumbles across a zombie feasting on the 
corpse of another person on the floor.  The eating zombie is wearing a STARS 
uniform.  The monster notices Rebecca is there and turns to face her.  It's 
Edward.)

Rebecca: (shocked) "Edward! No.."

(Edward gets up and with outstretched arms stumbles towards her.)

Rebecca: "Stop! Don't come any closer!"

***Rebecca Has Entered the Code***

(After Rebecca activates the brake, she radios to Billy.)

Rebecca: "This is Rebecca. I have engaged the control device for the brake. 
Over."

Billy: "Roger! I'll put the brake on now!"

***Billy Volunteers to Activate the Brake***

Billy: "I'll go over to the back deck and manipulate the control panel for the 
brake, then you apply the brake from here, ok?

Rebecca: "All right."

(Billy turns to leave.) 
 
Rebecca: "Billy!"

(Billy turns back to Rebecca.) 
 
Billy: "What?"

Rebecca: "Be careful."

Billy: "Yeah." 

***Billy Has Entered the Code***

(After Billy activates the brake, he radios Rebecca.)

Billy: "This is Billy. I have engaged the control device for the brake. Over."

Rebecca: "Roger. I'll put the brake on now!"

***The Iron Horse Falls***

(Billy/Rebecca enters the final code and pulls the lever to activate the brakes. 
Sparks fly from the metal wheels as the brakes try desperately to slow the 
train.  As the train hits the turn the right side of the train lifts off the 
track threatening to derail. But there was not enough momentum behind it and the 
train crashes back down onto the tracks and slices into the tunnel.  The tunnel 
however is a dead end and the train is going too fast to stop in time.  The 
train smashes through the barricade and jumps the track. The train turns in mid 
air and lands on its side and slides deeper into the tunnel before finally 
grinding to a halt.)

***Are You All Right?***

(Billy awakes to find himself on a pile of rubble outside the train.  He gets to 
his feet and looks around for his partner.)

Billy: (mumbling) "Rebecca..Rebecca!"

Rebecca: "I'm..here."

(Rebecca stumbles into view obviously injured from the crash.)

Billy: "Are you all right?  Hey, we managed to stop the train."

(Billy gestures at the wreck.)

Rebecca: "Yes..we managed."

Billy: "We have to find a way out."

***Who Are These People?***

(Pushing the panel aside, Billy and Rebecca step into a large hallway.  
Billy notices a design on the rug.)

Billy: "The Umbrella Research Center?"

(Rebecca is fixated on what seems to be a large painting of a man.  As she nears 
it she recognizes the face of the man as the leech monster thing from the 
train.)

Rebecca: (gasps)

Billy: "The first general manager, Dr. James Marcus."

(The scene cuts back to the control room where Wesker and Birkin are watching 
the pair look at the painting on their monitor.)

Birkin: "Who on earth are those people?"

Wesker: "She's just a rookie, a member of S.T.A.R.S."

Birkin: "Hmm, and what about the male."

Wesker: "I'm unfamiliar with him."

(A voice explodes from the speakers in the hallway.)

Birkin: "Hmm?"

(In the hall Rebecca and Billy look around trying to find the source of the 
voice.)

Voice: "Attention! This is Dr. Marcus. Please be silent as we reflect upon our 
company motto. Obedience breeds discipline, discipline breeds unity, unity 
breeds power, power is life.

(The monitors Wesker and Birkin are looking at switch to the image of the 
cloaked man seen from the train. The man chuckles.)

Wesker: "Who are you?"

Man: "It was I who scattered the T-Virus in the mansion, needless to say I 
contaminated the train too."

Birkin: "What?"

Man: "Revenge..on Umbrella!"

(The man closes his eyes and stretches out his arms and begins to sing.  As if 
responding to his call the leeches form a mass in front of him and reform the 
man Rebecca saw on the train.)

Birkin: "Dr. Marcus?"

Man: "Ten years ago, Dr. Marcus was murdered by Umbrella.  You helped them, 
didn't you?"

(Wesker scowls upon hearing this.)

(The man laughs as the scene fades.)

***Training Facility Scenes***

***Moving On Up***

(Upon placing the crank handle on the device, Billy can now send Rebecca to the 
third floor via a small elevator.  As Billy turns the crank, the rusty old 
device sends Rebecca into the unknown.)

***Raise It Higher***

(Once again, it's up to Billy to turn a crank and lift a heavy load, this time 
being an iron cage connected to a chain.)

***Captured***

(As Rebecca tries to exit the pool, a giant centipede smashes through the large 
grate on the wall and takes hold of Rebecca with it's many legs. The beast then 
rears back on it's hind legs and thrashes Rebecca about like a rag doll.)

Rebecca: "Augh! Ahhh, Billy!"

Billy: "Rebecca!"

***Give Me Freedom***

(In it's death throes, the beast relinquishes it's grip on Rebecca and falls 
motionless to the ground. Billy runs over to help Rebecca to her feet.)

Billy: "Rebecca! Are you all right?"

Rebecca: "Yes, thank you."

(They turn and gaze at the carcass of the insect.)

***It's That Time Again***

(Upon repairing the clock on the third floor, all the time locked doors have now 
been unlocked.)

***Uncross the Swords***

(Entering the code in the conference room will activate the mechanism to unlock 
the doors sealed by the swords of the knight statues.)

***Checkmate***

(Moving the large chess pieces to match the positions of the smaller ones will 
open a small hidden compartment.)

***The Balance of Good and Evil***

(The placement of the completed Devil and Angel statues upon the scales trigger 
a device, which causes the giant portrait of Dr. Marcus to descend to reveal a 
passageway into the facility basement levels.

***Gimme a Boost***

(Billy hoists Rebecca on his shoulders so she can reach the vent to reach the 
next room.)

Rebecca: "I'm almost there."

Billy: "Glad I could be of service. Time to go inside."

(The room Rebecca found herself was a gruesome torture chamber filled 
with all kinds of terrible devices)

***Show Me the Path***

(Success in supplying the power in the generator will open a few doors and stop 
the steam flow that blocked progress to another place in the facility.)

(Cut to control room)

***A New Playmate***

(A camera was watching Rebecca's every move in the torture room.  The voyeur 
being the strange singing man from before.)

Man: "You are wasting your time. I have already claimed this place for myself, 
which means you are trespassing and I am very territorial. (laughs)

(Somewhere the door to a cage slides open and a dark mass stirs inside.  The 
form turns to face the light and screams as it leaps to freedom.)

(Cut to torture room.)

***Lancelot Link, Psycho Chimp***

(As Rebecca wanders the torture room, she is joined by a new friend, a rabid 
primate.  The monkey jumps on her back and sinks its fangs into her flesh a time 
or two before she manages to throw it off.  The monkey howls in anger and leaps 
at the girl.  Rebecca dodges nimbly and rolls to the side away from the beast.  
As the creature nears her, the floor gives way and she falls into the darkness.)

(Cut to Hallway)

***The Plan***

(Wesker and Birkin are walking down the hall, towards an elevator.  Birkin is 
reading a document and gibbering.)

Birkin: "It just doesn't make sense. Do you honestly believe this to be the real 
identity of that crazy young man? Impossible. But, if somehow it is true then 
Umbrella will be finished."

Wesker: "If the old conspiracy against Dr. Marcus is revealed Mr. Spencer's 
career will be over, not to mention ours too. So, the time has come at last.

(The pair reaches the elevator and Wesker presses the button.) 

Birkin: "What are you going to do?"

(Wesker looks at Birkin)

Wesker: "I will simply say goodbye to Umbrella. The biological weapon utilizing 
the T-Virus has almost been completed. Our only remaining task is to acquire 
combat data. 

Birkin: "You can't be serious! I refuse to abandon my work! I've finished my 
research on the T-Virus, but I need a little more time to complete the more 
powerful G-Virus."

Wesker: "Do as you wish, I will follow my initial plan and lure the S.T.A.R.S. 
members into the mansion."

(The elevator doors open and Wesker enters, presses the button, and faces 
Birkin)

Wesker: "Their superior combat training should make them perfect test subjects." 
(laughs)

Birkin: "Fine, in the meantime, something must be done about that madman. As I 
recall, URC is equipped with a self-destruct device in the basement. I'll find 
it, set it off, and annihilate the place to nothing more than a mass of rubble."

(The elevator doors close cut to the pit as Rebecca struggles to hold on.)

Rebecca: "I can't..hold on."

***Lt. Coen's Secret***

(Billy reaches Rebecca just as she finally loses her grip and grabs her.)

Billy: "Rebecca! Hang on, I'll pull you up."

(Billy yanks Rebecca out of the pit and onto solid ground.)

Rebecca: "Thank you."

Billy: "Don't mention it, just keeping my word. We promised to cooperate with 
each other, remember?"

(Rebecca's radio beeps. She gets to her feet and replies.)

Rebecca: "This is Rebecca. Over."

Enrico: "Rebecca, this is Enrico. Have you managed to locate Coen yet? Over."

(Billy gets to his feet as Rebecca looks at him.)

Enrico: "Rebecca, answer me."

Rebecca: "No, sir, I've not found him yet. I'll continue to search for him. 
Over."

(Holsters her radio.)

Billy: "Rebecca."

Rebecca: "My first mission and I've already disobeyed orders. So much for my 
great law enforcement career. Oh well, I probably won't live long enough to 
worry about it? Billy, I just need to know, I need to know the truth. Did you 
kill 23 people? I won't judge you; I just want to know the truth.

Billy: "(sighs) It was around this time last year."

(Cut to jungle.  Soldiers marching through the brush and trees.)

Billy: "Our unit was ordered to Africa, to intervene in a civil war. Our mission 
was to raid a hideout of some guerilla forces located deep inside the jungle. 

(Soldiers being killed, guns firing.) 

But the hideout was far away from our entry point. Some died from the heat, 
others were killed by the enemy. In the end, only four of us survived.

(Soldiers reach a small village, cut to dungeon where Billy is leaning against a 
box with Rebecca standing in front of him.)

Billy: "Only there was no guerilla hideout."

Rebecca: "What do you mean?"

Billy: (angry) "The idiots in charge had us operating on wrong information! But, 
we couldn't just go home empty handed, oh no.  Our leader ordered us to attack 
an innocent village.

(Cut to village, one soldier firing his gun in the air as the other soldiers 
rounded up the villagers into a group.)

Commander: "Get rid of them! Kill them all!"

Billy: "Please, sir! Cease fire immediately!"

Commander: "Shut up!" 

(The commander knocks Billy to the ground with the butt of his weapon and gives 
the order to fire.)

Commander: "Do it!"

(Soldiers kill the group of villagers.)

Billy: "No! Don't! Stop!"

(Cut back to dungeon.)

Rebecca: "So did you execute those innocent people?"

Billy: "Forget about it. It doesn't matter anymore. That was then, this is now. 
Besides, you said you wouldn't judge me."

(Billy goes to leave, but Rebecca follows. Billy keeps his back to her.)

Rebecca: " I'm not judging you, but it does matter. Look, now my people think 
you killed those MPs in the van, but I don't think you did."

(Rebecca moves to face Billy.)

Rebecca: "It was those zombie dogs, right? When they attacked the van you were 
able to escape.  I, isn't that right?

Billy: "You don't get it." 

(Billy turns away from Rebecca.)

Billy: "I've only got two choices left. Either report to the Marines and serve 
out my sentence or keep on running for as long as I can. That's all."

***Ready? Fight!***

(Using one teammate to lower and raise the gates, and the other to reach and 
press the button will activate a "battle arena" program. Once the button was 
pressed, the door was barred and two Hunters were released into the room.)

Computer: "Battle sequence initiated. Locking door.

(Upon the deaths of the Hunters, the doors opened.)

Computer: "Battle sequence complete. Unlocking door.

***Tight Squeeze***

(Using the handle on the vise freed the tablet from it's grip.)

***No Need for Piano Lessons***

(Rebecca sits down to try her hand at playing the piano in the bar. Frustration 
commences.)
 
***Play It Again, Sam, er Billy***

(Billy played a little tune on the piano in the bar opened a secret passageway. 
Rebecca's taking of the battery inside the room closed the door.  Yet, Billy's 
musical fingers opened it up once again.)

***I Want My Phone Call***

(Taking the battery from the alcove in the wall triggers the secret door to 
close, trapping Rebecca inside.)

***Jail Break***

(Billy's talented musical fingers bust Rebecca loose from the hidden room.)

***First Floor: Boxes, Tablets, Annoying Puzzles***

(Placing the battery in the elevator panel outside the house brought the 
elevator to the ground level.)

***Descent***

(Placing all three tablets in the grooves in the observatory will trigger a 
mechanism that will cause the tower to descend into the lake and grant access to 
the church. Rebecca and/or Billy look about in concern at the vibrations of the 
tower they are in.)

***Laboratory Scenes***

***Unlock the Door***

(As one partner stands in front of the double doors to the church, the other 
heads to the small building to the right.  Stepping on one of the tiles in the 
corner of the building releases the lock on the double doors.)

***When Bats Attack***

(As the character leaves the save room a loud crash echoes through the building. 
Squeals and the beating of large wings echo throughout the large room. Looking 
skyward, the source of these sounds is confirmed to be a giant bat.  The bat 
squeals as it launches it's assault.)

***Grounded***

(The bat screeches in agony as it's wings fail to keep it aloft and the creature 
plunges to the floor.  It convulses a few times before finally going still.)

***Get the Power Up***

(Flipping the switch activates power to the elevator.  A light above the device 
lights up to confirm current flow.)

***Going Down?***

(The characters ride the elevator down into the lab.)

***Open Sesame!***

Pressing the button on the balcony above the main hall of the lab causes a wall 
to rise up to reveal the hallway continues further on inside.  Shambling around 
behind the false wall resides a Leech Zombie.)

***Who's That Man?***

(Billy/Rebecca locates an old photo album of Dr. Marcus as a young man.  The 
picture of the young Marcus looks similar to the cloaked man seen outside the 
train.)

Billy: (pouring over the album) "Judging from the age, that guy could be Marcus' 
son, or grandson."

Rebecca: (gasps) "That guy must be Marcus' son, or grandson."

***I Can Breathe Again***

(Placement of the sterilizing agent into the small machine clears the air inside 
the small chamber of the deadly gas.)

***Going My Way?***

(Billy locates an air train in the laboratory.  He radios Rebecca as he leaps 
over the railing and inspects his find.)

Billy: Maybe I could use this. 

Rebecca: "Rebecca here. Over.

Billy: "Billy. I found something here that might make you happy, it's an aerial 
cable car."

Rebecca: "Really? That's great, now we can get out."

Billy: "Yep, let's regroup as soon as possible."

Rebecca: "Roger."

(Rebecca locates an air cable car in the laboratory.  She radios Billy as she 
crawls under the railing.) 

Rebecca: "Now this is more like it."

Billy: "Billy here."

Rebecca: "Billy, I found an air cable car. We can get out of this place."

Billy: (excited) "Wait there, I'm coming!"

Rebecca: "Roger. The sooner we get out of here the better. Out."

***Moving the Ladder***

(By throwing the switch on the wall, the ladder above the cable car moves closer 
to the upper balcony allowing access to the upper floor.)

***All Aboard!***

(Placing the electronic parts on the control board in the office activates the 
power system to the cable car enabling the car to take the pair out of the lab.)

***Leaving So Soon?***

(As Billy and Rebecca approach the door to the car, a shadowy mass on top of the 
car moves to intercept.  Rebecca glances up in time to see it.)

Rebecca: (gasps)

(A rabid monkey leaps from the car at the duo. Rebecca pushes Billy out of the 
way of the attack. Angered by this, the monkey attacks Rebecca and slashes her 
side. Then the monkey turns it's attention to Billy and leaps at him. Billy 
catches the monkey by the arms, trying to fend off the monkey's claws.)

Billy: "Argh!"

Rebecca: "Billy!"

(Rebecca runs to help Billy, but he falls over the edge of the railing and into 
the darkness below."

***May I Have This Dance?***

(While Rebecca is looking over the edge of the cliff to try to find Billy, 
something is sneaking up behind her from the shadows. From the monster's point 
of view, Rebecca turns and finds herself face to face with a Leech Zombie.)

Rebecca: (gasps)

***Lights Out***

(After the leech monster confronts Rebecca, the power suddenly cuts off and the 
cable car goes dead.)

***Let There Be Light***

(In the small office, it is revealed that some leeches have removed a part from 
the power board. Upon the part's reinsertion the cable car jumps back to life.)

***On the Way***

(The cable car glide along the path depositing Rebecca in a new area.)

***Factory Scenes***

***Calling the Elevator***

(Using the key summons the giant cargo elevator from deep below.)

***Descending Into Terror***

(The platform shudders as it descends into the unknown with Rebecca in tow.)

***Old Friend***

(Rebecca stumbles upon another laboratory deep under the factory. As she 
searches around sounds come from the elevator shaft in front of her.  As she 
hides to the side of the elevator, Enrico steps into view, weapon drawn. He 
turns suddenly with his gun pointed directly at Rebecca.)

Rebecca: "Don't shoot!"

Enrico: (relieved, lowers his weapon.)

Rebecca: "You're alive!"

Enrico: "Are you okay, Rebecca?"

Rebecca: "Where is everybody?"

Enrico: (looks around) "They should have arrived here before me.  Haven't you 
seen them?"

(Rebecca shakes her head.)

Enrico: "That's unfortunate. If we go straight from here we should arrive at an 
old mansion, which Umbrella uses for research.  Come on, let's go.

(Enrico turns to leave, but Rebecca calls to him.)

Rebecca: "Wait! I've gotta find Billy."

Enrico: "Billy Coen? You mean you've found that criminal?"

Rebecca: "Yes, but we got separated and.."

Enrico: "No point worrying about him. He won't make it. Come on, let's go!"

Rebecca: "Sir, please. I need to find him. Don't worry, I'll catch up with you."

Enrico: "Rebecca.. (sighs) All right, just be careful.

(Enrico takes out his firearm and walks away.)

Rebecca's Voice: "I never saw him again."

***Enter: The Tyrant***

(Using the key on the locked elevator found earlier, Rebecca waits for the 
elevator to arrive.  As she waits, some rubble falls from the pile to the side.  
Rebecca looks over at the pile as a giant pasty white foot comes into view. 
Rebecca is shocked at the sight.)

Rebecca: "What is that?"

(The titan on top of the rubble roars in greeting as it leaps from the pile 
directly in front of the girl.  The monster approaches slowly, it's twitching 
body seemingly hard to control.  The beast takes a swing at her with it's huge 
claw.  Rebecca ducks out of the way just in time and rolls behind the behemoth.  
Rebecca desperately looks for a way to escape as the monster turns to face her.  
She then sees that the door out of danger is quickly closing, trapping her in 
with the mutant.)

***After the Battle***

(Rebecca stares at the fallen giant as the elevator chimes behind her.  The 
elevator has arrived.)


***Treatment Plant Scenes***

***Revenge***

(Someone is watching Rebecca from a monitor in a room somewhere.  Moments later, 
a few leeches glide across the screen, leaving slime trails in their wake.  The 
robed man appears cradling a leech on his arm, muttering to no one in general.)

Man: (laughs) "Playtime is over. You and your friends no longer amuse me. Good 
riddance. Now nothing will stop me from getting my revenge!"

***Cast Away***

(As Rebecca exits the elevator, she finds herself on a bridge above a raging 
river.  As she glances around she spots Billy hanging on a rock out in the 
rapidly moving water.  She calls out to him.)

Rebecca: "Billy!"

(Rebecca spots a dark shadow moving under the water.)

Rebecca: "Billy!"

(The mass launches Billy up into the air and sends him crashing into the river. 
The river swiftly carries him away into a tunnel as Rebecca cries out for him.)

Rebecca: "No, Billy!"

***Now You're Playing With Power***

(Supplying power to the damn reboots the system and the lights all over the 
factory spring to life.)

***Finding a Friend***

(Rebecca finds Billy on the floor near a drainage ditch water. She rushes to 
help him up.)

Rebecca: "Billy!"

(As she lifts him up, he coughs up some water and gasps for air.) 

Billy: "Rebecca..where am I?"

Rebecca: "You're safe now. Are you ok?"

(Billy notices something to the side.)

Rebecca: "Hmm?"

(Over in the corner of the ditch is a pile of human skeletons.)

Rebecca: "What could have done this?

Billy: "They must have been used as test subjects in Marcus' research. He must 
have kept messing around with the Mother Virus!"

(Billy flashes back to a time long past, images of decomposing bodies. As he 
recalls this memory he breaks out into a cold sweat.)

Rebecca: (concerned) "Billy?"

***Fill Her Up***

(Hitting the Drain/Flood switch opens the floodgates and water pours out of the 
vent into the pool.)

***Twist It***

(Using the tool on the door opens the lock.)

***Return of the Tyrant***

(As Rebecca/Billy passes the stagnant pool, a familiar claw pierces the surface 
and latches onto the edge.  As the creature pulls itself up from the muck, 
Rebecca/Billy turns around to face the monster once again.)

***Lower the Ladder***

(Pressing the button sends a ladder down from the upper floor.)

***Call the Gondola***

(Placing the motherboard back into the circuit, allows the gondola to return 
from the other side of the dam.)

***Gondola Ride***

(Rebecca hops in the gondola to ride to the floodgate control room.)

***Open the Floodgates***

(Turning the lever raises the floodgates on the dam to clear the excess water 
from the walkway over the river.)

***Lift Me Up***

(Billy boosts Rebecca onto his shoulders so she can pull herself up to a high 
shelf.)

***Call the Exterminators***

(Two mutant insects burst from their capsules and rush the pair.)
***Using the Forklift***

(One partner stands on the box on the forklift while the other sends the lift 
up.)

***Spencer's Plot***

(Rebecca and Billy enter the incinerator to find the room completely crawling 
with the leech creatures.  The man in the cloak walks across the upper balcony 
and welcomes them.)

Rebecca & Billy: (gasps)

Man: "Welcome, young ones. So glad you have joined the party. You are the guests 
of honor, after all it's your wake."

Billy: "Who are you?"

(The man transforms into an elderly man.)

Billy: "Dr. Marcus?"

Rebecca: "no, you can't be!"

Marcus: (laughs) "Ten years ago, Spencer had me assassinated."

(Marcus flashes back to that time years ago. Marcus is examining a leech in his 
lab when two soldiers barge in and spray the lab with gunfire.  Marcus falls to 
the floor, moments later the leech he was examining follows him.  The two 
soldiers step aside as two men dressed in lab coats walk in.  One of them is 
wearing sunglasses.  Wesker and Birkin. They lean in to the fallen researcher 
and gloat.)

Wesker: "Ah, time to die, doctor."

Birkin: "I will take over your research." (laughs)

(Marcus' body is tossed into a pool and he sinks, the water stained red with his 
blood.)

Marcus: (weakly) "Wesker..Birkin.."

(Scene switches to the leech crawling along the floor and into Marcus' body. 
Damage done by the bullets is healed.)

Marcus: "However, something wondrous happened, it took the T-Virus inside of my 
queen years to procreate my new life."

(The flashback returns to Marcus who has returned to his younger form.)

Marcus: "I live. Now I will have my revenge on Umbrella, and the world will burn 
in an inferno of hate!" (laughs)

(Billy shakes his fist at the man.)

Billy: "You'll pay for what you've done!"

Marcus: "We'll see which one of us is gonna die!" (laughs)

(Suddenly the man vomits up slime. The man seems shocked as leeches pour from 
his mouth.)

Billy: "Huh?"

Rebecca: (gasps)

(The man's body ripples and mutates into a gigantic leech-like creature. The 
beast roars and a jump to the ceiling takes it over the railing then the mutant 
drops down in front of it's soon to be victims.)

***She's Going Down***

The Queen shrieks in pain and collapses to the floor, motionless.)

***The Final Door***

(Rebecca and Billy unlock the door leading to the escape lift.)

***Hail to the Queen***

(Billy and Rebecca are riding the elevator to freedom when a crash is heard.)

Rebecca: "What?"

Billy: "It's the Queen!"

(Down the shaft, the Queen Leech can be seen emerging through a hole in the 
wall.)

Computer Voice: "The self-destruct has been activated. All personnel evacuate 
immediately."

Rebecca: "Who activated the self destruct system?"

(Billy messes with the controls.)

Billy: "Come on! Can't this thing move any faster?"

(The Queen begins to pursue the elevator.)

***Pursuit***

(The Queen charges the lift and rams it, throwing Rebecca and Billy off it and 
onto the floor.)

Billy: "Shit!"

(The Queen smashes the lift to pieces and stands in front of the duo.  The 
morning sun is filtering through a hole in the roof onto the creature. The 
creature's flesh starts to smoke and burn as the Queen howls in pain.)

***Let the Sunshine In***

Rebecca: "Billy, it can't handle sunlight! We need to open the windows!"

Billy: " Follow me!"

(They run to a control panel. The Queen plods after them. Billy turns to face 
the Queen.)

Billy: "You work on the windows!"

Rebecca: "Got it!"

Billy: "I'll use my charm to distract her majesty."

***Off With Her Head!***

The roof opens up and lets the blazing sunlight down onto the leech's frail 
body. Although the Queen's body is in horrible pain, it can still manage to send 
Rebecca and Billy to the ground with a powerful attack.  Rebecca notices a gun 
near her and tosses it to Billy.)

Rebecca: "Billy!"

(Billy readies himself and fires the gun at the queen.)

Billy: "Hey, Queenie! Feast on this!"

(The bullet tears through the Queen's slimy body literally punching a hole in 
her. She falls back down the elevator shaft, her body coming apart as it falls. 
Halfway down she meets the explosions from the facility and is burned to a 
crisp.)

Rebecca: "Billy!"

Billy: "Rebecca, hurry!"

(Rebecca and Billy flee the scene just as the facility is blown to bits.)

***Conclusion***

(Later, on a cliff overlooking the forest, Billy and Rebecca catch their breath. 
Billy throws his handcuffs off the cliff and lies on his back. Rebecca spots an 
old house in the forest at the foot of the cliff.)

Rebecca: "Hey that must be the old mansion Enrico was talking about."

(Billy sits up and looks at the house. Rebecca leans over and takes Billy's dog 
tag and places it around her neck. Bill stands in front of her.)

Rebecca: "I guess it's time to say goodbye.  Officially, Lt Billy Coen is dead."

Billy: "Yeah, I'm just a zombie now."

(Rebecca salutes Billy and he reciprocates, then Rebecca turns around and 
proceeds to the mansion.)

Billy: "Thank you, Rebecca."

(Billy gives her a "thumbs up" before turning and leaving. The scene pans to the 
mansion and fades out on a butterfly trapped in a spider web.)
