Jill,Female,"It all began as an ordinary day in September. An ordinary day in Raccoon City. A city controlled by Umbrella. No one dared to oppose them. And that lack of strength would ultimately lead to their destruction. I suppose they had to suffer the consequences for their actions. But there would be no forgiveness. If only they had the courage to fight. It’s true that once the wheels of justice begin to turn, nothing can stop them. Nothing. It was Raccoon City’s last chance. And my last chance. My last escape."
Helicopter pilot,,This is Chopper Delta. Prepare to drop off at Area E95072. Over.
Man,Male,What are they?! No!
Officer 1,,Blockade is ready. Awaiting orders. Over.
Radio,,All units proceed to Richmond and Victoria...
Soldier 1,,"All right, let’s do it."
Soldier 2,,"Go, go, go!"
Officer 2,,Fire!
Officer 3,,Come and get it!
Officer 4,,Son of a…
Officer 5,,Don’t give up!
Soldier 3,,Where are they?
Soldier 4,,Where did they come from?
Soldier 5,,Die!
Soldier 6,,You want some more?
Jill,Female,September Twenty-Eighth. Daylight. The monsters have overtaken the city. Somehow… I’m still alive…
Jill,Female,Okay. We’ve gotta get out of here.
Dario,Male,What? What do you think you’re talking about? I just lost my daughter out there! How dare you tell me to go back outside!
Jill,Female,I’m sorry about your daughter. But there isn’t going to be any rescue! We have to get out of here!
Dario,Male,No! I’m not going anywhere! I rather starve myself than be eaten by one of those undead monsters! Now leave me alone!
Dario,Male,Told you! I’m not leaving! Never! Just get away from me.
Brad,Male,Get away!
Jill,Female,"Brad, hang in there. Why isn’t someone doing something about this?"
Brad,Male,"I didn’t know you were still alive, Jill. The police aren’t trained for this kind of situation. What could they do? Listen, he’s coming for us. We’re both gonna die!"
Jill,Female,What are you saying?
Brad,Male,You’ll see. He’s after STARS members. There’s no escape.
Brad,Male,Jill!
Jill,Female,Brad!
Brad,Male,Jill! Help! No!
Jill,Female,No!
Jill,Female,Brad...?
Nemesis,Male,STARS.
Carlos,Male,"No. Come in, anyone. Our platoon is cut off. No survivors found. This is Carlos. Head… Towards… Immediately."
Jill,Female,What’s that?
Carlos,Male,"Calm down, lady. I’m no zombie. My name is Carlos, corporal of Umbrella’s Biohazard Countermeasure Force. What’s your name?"
Jill,Female,Jill. Did you just say you belong to Umbrella’s army?
Carlos,Male,"Yeah. We came all the way out here to save your civilians, but the mission went bad the minute we landed."
Jill,Female,No. How did he find me?
Jill,Female,This way!
Jill,Female,Wait. I have to ask you something.
Carlos,Male,I know. You wanna ask me out. All the foxy ladies have my accent. It drives them crazy.
Jill,Female,"What? Keep dreaming. Tell me, why did Umbrella send your team in?"
Carlos,Male,We’re here to rescue the civilians.
Jill,Female,Don’t lie to me! Umbrella is the reason why this whole mess began!
Carlos,Male,"Look, we’re just mercenaries. Hired hands. You really think the master would tell his dog why he has to retrieve the stick he just threw? If you want answers, you should talk to someone else. I am not with Umbrella."
Carlos,Male,"We have to finish this later. Believe it or not, we’re only here to rescue the civilians. If you can trust me, then help us! Think about it!"
Jill,Female,Over here!
Carlos,Male,Are you crazy?! You could’ve barbecued both of us!
Jill,Female,I need to ask you something. Why did Umbrella send your team here?
Carlos,Male,Our mission is to rescue the civilians.
Jill,Female,"How kind of you. Considering that Umbrella caused all this in the first place, those liars!"
Carlos,Male,"Look, we’re just mercenaries. Hired hands."
Carlos,Male,"No time for talking. If you can believe me, then join us. Think about it!"
Jill,Female,Hey.
Carlos,Male,What? Where am I?
Jill,Female,Relax. You’re fine.
Carlos,Male,"If you say so, but my head feels like it’s about to explode. Anyway, name’s Carlos. Glad to meet you, lady."
Jill,Female,Jill. Alpha Team. R.P.D. STARS Unit. Who do you represent?
Carlos,Male,"STARS? I see. Well, I’m a member of the Biohazard Countermeasure Force sent by Umbrella Corporation."
Jill,Female,Sent by Umbrella?
Carlos,Male,"Hey, don’t look at me like that! What did I say? Do you have a problem?"
Jill,Female,Oh no! It’s him!
Jill,Female,I need to ask you something. Why did Umbrella send your team here?
Carlos,Male,Our mission is to rescue the civilians.
Jill,Female,"How kind of you. Considering Umbrella caused all this in the first place, those liars!"
Carlos,Male,"Look, we’re just mercenaries. Hired hands. Do you really think the master would tell his dog why he would have to retrieve the stick he just threw?"
Carlos,Male,"No time for talking. If you can believe me, then join us. Think about it!"
Jill,Female,Come on!
Carlos,Male,"Ow! That kill! Just so you know, I’m not into that ‘Pain is Pleasure’ thing, okay?"
Jill,Female,Just deal with it. That thing wants me dead. We gotta get out of here!
Jill,Female,Wait. I have to ask you something.
Carlos,Male,I know. You wanna ask me out. All the foxy ladies have my accent. It drives them crazy.
Jill,Female,I have to know. Why did Umbrella send you here?
Carlos,Male,"Because, we’re on a civilian rescue mission."
Jill,Female,"Oh, you’re full of it! They’re the ones who caused all of this in the first place!"
Carlos,Male,"Look, we’re just mercenaries. Hired hands. You really think the master would tell his dog why he has to retrieve the stick he just threw?"
Carlos,Male,"Listen, if you want answers about Umbrella, you’re asking the wrong guy. Believe it or not, we’re only here to rescue civilians. If you can trust me, join us. Think about it!"
Jill,Female,"You’re one of the survivors from the rescue team, right? I just ran into your teammate, Carlos."
Nicholai,Male,How did a girl like you manage to survive?
Jill,Female,"Hey, I’m no ordinary civy. I’m a member of STARS."
Nicholai,Male,STARS? You mean the R.P.D. special force team?
Jill,Female,"Hey, is someone wounded back there?"
Jill,Female,"Oh, this looks bad."
Mikhail,Male,They’re coming. Get ready! Vile...vile! Stand together!
Jill,Female,Calm down. You’re safe now. Everything’s going to be okay.
Carlos,Male,"So Jill, you decide to help us out? It looks like we’re the only ones who survived. We should work together."
Nicholai,Male,No. We can’t trust her.
Carlos,Male,"Why? But Sergeant, we need her help! Our unit’s down to you, me, and Lieutenant Mikhail. That’s it! And Mikhail’s hurt bad. If we don’t cooperate, we won’t be walking away from this mission."
Nicholai,Male,"Hmm, fine. Then let’s go over our plan. We’re moving to the Clock Tower area, which is the designated landing zone for the extraction chopper. Once we get there, and give the signal, the chopper will fly in and pull us out."
Carlos,Male,That’s a lot of ground to cover. I don’t think we can make it on foot.
Nicholai,Male,"The main problem we have is the landing zone is cut off from here by the fire. So, we have no choice but to use this cable car to navigate through it. Fortunately, we can use it as a moving shield to get us through the worst areas."
Carlos,Male,"That works for me. Good plan, sir!"
Nicholai,Male,"Okay people, let’s get moving!"
Carlos,Male,"Jill, put this on."
Nicholai,Male,Wait!
Jill,Female,What did you do?!
Nicholai,Male,"I had no choice. He was about to turn into a zombie. It would’ve been a threat, so I eliminated it."
Jill,Female,"But, he was still conscious, wasn’t it?"
Nicholai,Male,"He was as good as dead, and it took fewer bullets to kill him now than it would have if he had transformed."
Nicholai,Male,Not now! I’m busy!
Carlos,Male,No!
Carlos,Male,"Don’t make me do this, Murphy! I don’t want to shoot you!"
Murphy,Male,Kill me! I’m finished. Not human.
Carlos,Male,Wait! We… We don’t have to do this!
Murphy,Male,"Please, hurry… Before I lose consciousness. Before it’s too late... Kill me!"
Carlos,Male,"Murphy. Why? No, no..."
Jill,Female,Carlos!
Jill,Female,"Mikhail, do you have some kind of death wish?"
Mikhail,Male,My people...they were wiped out by these monsters! I can’t stop just because I’m wounded!
Jill,Female,But can’t you see those monsters are also the victims of Umbrella?
Mikhail,Male,Are you accusing me of taking it out on them? You don’t seem to understand something. We’re not really involved with the company! There’s no reason for any of us to take responsibility for this mess!
Jill,Female,"I know that...and right now, that’s the only reason why I’m trying to cooperate with you."
Mikhail,Male,I’m sorry. I feel so useless.
Jill,Female,Don’t. You fought hard and have the wounds to prove it.
Mikhail,Male,But… I’m still… alive. My men aren’t...
Jill,Female,Don’t think about that now. Just rest.
Nicholai,Male,I’ll check over there.
Jill,Female,Nicholai!
Carlos,Male,Jill!
Carlos,Male,"Hey, the zombies are getting restless."
Jill,Female,I know. I can hear them. What’s going on?
Carlos,Male,Jill!
Jill,Female,What’s wrong?!
Carlos,Male,They’re coming! They must’ve sniffed us out! They know we’re here!
Jill,Female,"Hey, calm down."
Carlos,Male,Any objections to my playing hero this time?
Jill,Female,What are you doing?!
Jill,Female,Carlos!
Carlos,Male,Eat this!
Jill,Female,Carlos! No!
Carlos,Male,Relax. I’m not dead yet.
Jill,Female,Are you okay?
Carlos,Male,"I’m fine. Huh, that hero stuff is harder than it looks."
Carlos,Male,"Ouch. My ears are ringing. We both should be deaf by now. Olay, I’m gonna scrounge some equipment. There might not be any at our destination."
Jill,Female,"Carlos, I’m sorry about Murphy, but there was nothing you could have done."
Carlos,Male,"Yeah...You’re right, Jill. I’ll operate the cable car."
Jill,Female,"Uh...Nicholai...won’t be joining us. Come on, let’s go."
Carlos,Male,"It looks like we’re ready to go. Here, take this."
Jill,Female,Okay. Uh… Nicholai… won’t be joining us.
Carlos,Male,I understand. I’ll operate the cable car. Let’s go.
Carlos,Male,It’s looking good.
Carlos,Male,Mikhail!
Jill,Female,Mikhail!
Mikhail,Male,"Jill, get out of the cable car now!"
Jill,Female,"Mikhail, wait! Don’t!"
Mikhail,Male,There’s no time! Hurry!
Mikhail,Male,Come one! Come on!
Mikhail,Male,Just...a little closer...
Mikhail,Male,You lose...
Jill,Female,Mikhail...
Carlos,Male,No! The brakes are out!
Jill,Female,It’s useless!
Carlos,Male,No!
Jill,Female,It must be...
Jill,Female,Carlos. I don’t believe it. You’re alive.
Carlos,Male,I’m not sure how we are gonna get out of this town.
Jill,Female,What are you thinking about? We made it!
Carlos,Male,You don’t get it! They have no intention of letting us make it back alive! Do you really think we can trust their ‘great evacuation plan’? Huh! It’s just a piece of paper!
Jill,Female,We don’t have any other choice than to trust them right now.
Carlos,Male,"No! If we’re gonna die, then we should get to choose when it happens!"
Jill,Female,"So that’s it then, huh? You’re giving up?"
Carlos,Male,No… I just… I can’t handle it!
Nemesis,Male,STARS.
Jill,Female,We’re saved. Down here!
Jill,Female,It’s finally over...
Jill,Female,Huh? No!
Jill,Female,No...
Carlos,Male,Jill!
Jill,Female,Carlos...
Carlos,Male,"Jill! Jill. Hey, don’t die on me."
Carlos,Male,Jill! Jill!
Carlos,Male,"Jill! Jill, hang in there! What have I done? I’m sorry Jill. Please, wake up!"
Carlos,Male,Jill! Jill!
Jill,Female,October First. Night. I woke up to the sound of falling rain. I can’t believe I’m still. Alive.
Jill,Female,Carlos...?
Carlos,Male,"It looks like our roles have been reversed from when we originally met, huh? Don’t worry, Jill. This chapel is safe."
Jill,Female,"I’ve been infected by the virus, haven’t I?"
Carlos,Male,"Hey, take it easy."
Jill,Female,"I’m okay. I don’t feel any pain. But that’s what bothers me. If I can’t feel anything, then what does that mean?"
Carlos,Male,"Don’t give up, Jill. I’ll take care of you! Whatever you do, don’t let that virus beat you!"
Jill,Female,If I turn into a zombie don’t hesitate. I want your word that you’ll kill me...
Nicholai,Male,Don’t shoot! No!
Carlos,Male,Nicholai? You’re still alive?
Nicholai,Male,You saw what happened?
Carlos,Male,What’s going on?
Nicholai,Male,I’m one of the supervisors. That’s all you need to know.
Carlos,Male,Wait!
Carlos,Male,We barely made it. How do you feel?
Jill,Female,I’m okay. What happened to you?
Carlos,Male,"I just fought with that monster. Uh, I’ve got some bad news. Nicholai’s still alive."
Jill,Female,But I thought he was dead!
Carlos,Male,"Heh, that guy doesn’t know the meaning of the word dead."
Jill,Female,What is he after?
Carlos,Male,"I don’t know. All I know is that he is our enemy. I’m sorry Jill, but there is something I gotta take care of. I promise I’ll meet up with you later."
Carlos,Male,"Hey, are you okay?"
Jill,Female,"Yes, barely. What’s going on?"
Carlos,Male,No way! That monster just doesn’t give up!
Jill,Female,What? I thought we killed that thing!
Carlos,Male,No. It’s been waiting for you!
Jill,Female,"He’s playing with us. Carlos, do you think that it’s unstoppable?"
Carlos,Male,"No, I don’t think so. I’m sorry Jill, but I gotta go take care of a few things. Oh, and...bad news. Nicholai is still alive."
Jill,Female,Nicholai? Are you sure?
Carlos,Male,"Yes. I don’t know how, but I do know that he is our enemy. Remember, don’t trust him!"
Radio,,All supervisors. Mission terminated. Return immediately. Repeat:  All supervisors return immediately. Over.
Nicholai,Male,I’m quite impressed you managed to stay alive up until now.
Jill,Female,And you seem to be doing a pretty good job at looking after yourself. How about helping out?
Nicholai,Male,I have no intention of helping you.
Jill,Female,Because we’re nothing but pawns in all of this?
Nicholai,Male,"In a manner of speaking, you are. Our employers want detailed analysis of the zombie beings, which were created through infection by the T-virus."
Jill,Female,You’re saying that they deliberately sent in a military unit to be butchered by their creations?
Nicholai,Male,"Note exactly. Although the conditions encountered on this operation were extreme, it was...an unexpected outcome that the team would be wiped out. We were only required to collect live data from the subjects."
Nicholai,Male,Another mutant!
Jill,Female,What’s going on? Whoa!
Jill,Female,What’s that?
Jill,Female,No.
Jill,Female,Carlos.
Carlos,Male,"Jill, listen very carefully. They’re planning on launching a missile directly into the city as soon as day breaks. The explosion will be powerful enough to destroy everything!"
Jill,Female,Are you sure about that?
Carlos,Male,Positive. I heard it from a supervisor.
Jill,Female,They’ll go this far to cover their tracks?
Carlos,Male,Come on. We have to hurry. There isn’t much time left!
Carlos,Male,Rescuing you is becoming a full-time job.
Jill,Female,Thanks Carlos. I owe you one.
Carlos,Male,Listen closely Jill. They’re going to launch a missile directly into the city as soon as day breaks.
Jill,Female,At dawn? But that’s only…
Carlos,Male,"I know. We don’t have much time left. We have to split up and find a way out of here. And hey, watch out for that traitor Nicholai."
Jill,Female,Nicholai?
Nicholai,Male,You’re still wandering around.
Jill,Female,"Nicholai? So, you wanna get out of here alone. Is that your plan?"
Nicholai,Male,"I made certain that none of the other supervisors survived. Since I’’ be the only one who knows what really happened, I’ll have more...bargaining power when it comes to discussing my bonus."
Jill,Female,Then why kill me? I’m not on their payroll.
Nicholai,Male,"Well, they want you eliminated for reasons of their own. The amount is modest, but there is a reward to be claimed upon the confirmation of your death."
Jill,Female,That’s great! Except I have no intention in contributing to your retirement fund!
Announcement,,Warning. Proceeding with Operation Number Thirteen. Please evacuate immediately.
Nemesis,Male,STARS.
Announcement,,Warning. Missile attack confirmed. All personnel evacuate immediately.
Carlos,Male,"Jill. Jill, where are you? If you can hear this transmission, respond immediately!"
Jill,Female,I’m here. What’s up?
Carlos,Male,I got us a ride. The chopper engines are running and ready to go.
Jill,Female,On my way.
Carlos,Male,This city is about to become Ground Zero. Hurry up! And don’t forget to take that device with you!
Jill,Female,What does it do?
Carlos,Male,that device tracks the distance of the approaching missile. Make sure you bring it with you. Now listen. Don’t give up. We're both gonna survive this! Just get over there!
Announcement,,Warning. Missile attack confirmed. Warning missile attack confirmed. Emergency Level B. All personnel evacuate immediately.
Nicholai,Male,You’re still alive. Such persistence.
Jill,Female,Nicholai?
Nicholai,Male,"Sorry, but there is no escape for you."
Jill,Female,"So, you wanna get out of here alone. Is that your plan?"
Nicholai,Male,"I made certain that none of the other supervisors survived. Since I’d be the only one who knows what really happened, I’ll have more...bargaining power when it comes to discussing my bonus."
Jill,Female,Then why kill me? I’m not on their payroll.
Nicholai,Male,"Well, they want you eliminated for reasons of their own. The amount is modest, but there is a reward to be claimed upon the confirmation of your death."
Nicholai,Male,Although I’m sure I’ll miss you. It’s time to say goodbye. You can either accept death with dignity or die with regret. It’s entirely up to you.
Carlos,Male,"Jill, what happened?"
Jill,Female,Carlos. Nicholai beat us to the chopper.
Carlos,Male,I guess this is it then. But I don’t wanna die in a place like this! This isn’t over yet! I’m not giving up Jill! We still have a chance!
Carlos,Male,I am not going to give up!
Carlos,Male,"Jill, that’s it! We gotta find a way outta here now!"
Announcement,,Warning. Missile attack confirmed. Warning missile attack confirmed. Emergency Level B. All personnel evacuate immediately.
Carlos,Male,"Jill, what happened?"
Jill,Female,Carlos. The chopper is...
Carlos,Male,I guess this is it then. But I don’t wanna die in a place like this! This isn’t over yet! I’m not giving up Jill! We still have a chance!

Carlos,Male,Jill!

Jill,Female,I guess we’re all set.
Carlos,Male,"All right then, we’re outta here."
Jill,Female,Oh no.
Carlos,Male,It’s here. It’s time to go.
Jill,Female,"That’s it. I had it. This time, they’ve gone too far."
Carlos,Male,Jill!
Jill,Female,"It’s over, Carlos."
Carlos,Male,"What are you talking about? Don’t you hear that? There’s a second chopper, and it’s here to rescue you!"
Jill,Female,But who is it? Who could possibly be looking for me?
Carlos,Male,It doesn’t matter. We just have to be there when it lands.
Jill,Female,Thanks. You saved us.
Barry,Male,I couldn’t let you die.
Jill,Female,Is… is it you?
Jill,Female,It’s coming!
Barry,Male,Yeah. It’s the end.
Jill,Female,That’s it. Umbrella’s going down.
Reporter,,"And now, we have a rather unfortunate turn of events. It seems that the president and the federal council have passed judgment over the civilians of Raccoon City. The president and the federal council have ruled that the bacillus-terminate operation is the best course of action for this extreme situation and have since executed it. Based on that fact, Raccoon City has been literally wiped off the map. Current reports have the death toll surpassing the 100,000 mark. Our hearts go out to those poor civilians of Raccoon City."
