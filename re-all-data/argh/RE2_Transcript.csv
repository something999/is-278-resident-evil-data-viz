Narrator,,"A bizarre incident occurred in the outskirts of an American suburb called Racoon City. It was later revealed that the terrible disaster had been caused by the T-Virus, a mutagenic toxin created by the international corporation Umbrella incorporated. The Racoon police department special STARS Unit began an immediate investigation. The case was apparently closed thanks to the efforts of STARS members Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine. But the Umbrella Corporation’s experiments were far from finished."
Leon,Male,What have we got here?
Truck Driver,,That guy's a maniac! Why’d he bite me?
Leon,Male,"Man, what a mess! What could have done this?"
Leon,Male,What are these things?
Leon,Male,"All right, that’s far enough! Don’t move!"
Leon,Male,No!
Leon,Male,What’s up with this guy that was a clean hit!
Claire,Female,"Wait, don’t shoot!"
Leon,Male,Get down!
Leon,Male,"We can’t stay out here. Get to the police station, it’ll be a lot safer."
Leon,Male,There!
Leon,Male,Let’s buckle up.
Claire,Female,What’s going on? I arrived in town and the whole place went insane...
Leon,Male,Great the radio’s out!
Claire,Female,"You’re a cop, right?"
Leon,Male,"Yeah, first day on the job. Great, huh? Name's Leon Kennedy, nice to meet you."
Claire,Female,Mine’s Claire. Claire Redfield. I came to find my brother Chris.
Leon,Male,"Hey, could you open the glove box?"
Claire,Female,Sure.
Claire,Female,There’s a gun inside.
Leon,Male,Better take it with you.
Leon,Male,No!
Claire,Female,Look out!
Leon,Male,Are you okay?
Claire,Female,Still in one piece.
Leon,Male,That maniac’s gonna ram us!
Leon,Male,Claire!
Claire,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,I’m okay! Head to the station. I’ll meet you there.
Kendo,Male,"Freeze! Who are you, what are you doing here?"
Leon,Male,Hold your fire. I’m a human.
Kendo,Male,"Oh, sorry about that. I thought you were one of them."
Leon,Male,What’s going on in this town?
Kendo,Male,Hold on.
Kendo,Male,"I don’t know what’s going on. By the time I noticed something was wrong, the entire city was infested with zombies."
Leon,Male,Oh Man!
Marvin,Male,"Who... Who are you? Oh, you must be the new guy, Leon. Sorry, but it looks like your party has been canceled."
Leon,Male,What happened?
Marvin,Male,"About two months ago, there was this incident involving zombies in a mansion located in the outskirts of this city. Chris and the other STARS members discovered that Umbrella was behind everything. They risked their lives to reveal the truth, but no one believed them. Not long after that, all this started to happen."
Leon,Male,Hang in there!
Marvin,Male,"Don’t worry about me. Just rescue the survivors in the other rooms. Here, take this key card. You should be able to unlock the doors in the hall with this. Now go!"
Leon,Male,But...
Marvin,Male,Just go!
Leon,Male,"Fine, but I’m coming back for you. Just hold on!"
Claire,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,Good to see you're still among the living. It looks like we’re not going to find your brother here after all.
Leon,Male,"There’s no reason for us to stay any longer than we have to. Let’s split up, look for any survivors and get out of here."
Claire,Female,Right.
Leon,Male,"One last thing, here’s a radio. Take it. That way we can keep in touch if anything happens."
Ada,Female,"Sorry, but when I saw the uniform I thought you were another zombie."
Leon,Male,Who are you?
Ada,Female,"Ada, Ada Wong."
Leon,Male,And what are you doing here?
Ada,Female,"I’m looking for a guy named Ben. He’s one of those reporter types, always looking for a scoop. I heard he was locked up in the cell block, only there’s a wrecked car barring the entrance. I’ve been trying to find another way inside. If we work together we can move this thing. Will you give me a hand?"
Leon,Male,"Ada, wait!"
Leon,Male,"Let me guess, you must be Ben right? Get up now!"
Ben,Male,What do you want; I’m trying to sleep here!
Leon,Male,Is this the guy?
Ada,Female,"Ben, you told the city officials that you knew something about what’s going on. What did you tell them?"
Ben,Male,And who the heck are you?
Ada,Female,"I’m trying to find my boyfriend, his name’s John. He was working for a branch office of Umbrella based in Chicago but he suddenly disappeared six months ago. I heard rumors he was here in the city."
Ben,Male,"I don’t know anything and even if I did, why would I want to tell you?"
Leon,Male,"Okay, I say we leave him in here. Anyone know where they put the key to this cell?"
Ben,Male,I have it right here officer. But I’m not about to leave this cell. Those zombies aren’t the only things crawling around out there.
Leon,Male,What was that?
Ben,Male,"Like I said, I’m not leaving this Cell. There’s a kennel in the back of the building. Inside the kennel is a manhole. Go through and it will lead you to the sewer entrance, but it won’t be easy."
Leon,Male,"Ada, why don’t you let me introduce myself. My name's Leon. I’m with the RPD. It’s a dead end."
Ada,Female,Do you think we can get upstairs through this shaft? Give me a boost I’ll go and check.
Ada,Female,"Leon, can you hear me?"
Leon,Male,Ada did you find anything?
Ada,Female,Right here.
Ada,Female,I can’t reach the ventilation hole. I'm going to have to find another way around. I’ll catch up with you.
Leon,Male,What? Ada... Wait!
Ben,Male,No!
Ben,Male,Get away!
Leon,Male,"Ben! Can you still hear me? Come on, answer me!"
Leon,Male,Ben?
Ben,Male,"Bitter irony. The chief of police, a co-conspirator."
Ben,Male,Get that scum. Make him pay!
Leon,Male,"Hang in there, Ben."
Ben,Male,My chest. It's burning!
Leon,Male,What’s wrong?
Ada,Female,"Good God, what was that?"
Leon,Male,We now have access to the back of the parking lot.
Leon,Male,Ada! Running off like that was reckless and stupid! Those zombies are everywhere not to mention that thing that got Ben.
Ada,Female,"I was there Leon, I know."
Leon,Male,"Look, Ada. As an officer, it’s my job to look out for you. But we’re not going to get through this alive if we don’t work together."
Ada,Female,"All right, we’ll do this your way. For now."
Leon,Male,Ada!
Ada,Female,Leon! That woman was... I have to talk to her.
Annette,Female,Don’t move. You’re the one who was with that cop if I remember correctly. Identify yourself.
Ada,Female,Ada. Ada Wong.
Annette,Female,"Ada Wong? I’ve heard that name before. Now I remember. One of the men from Chicago came to assist the T-Virus research. He used his girlfriend’s name as his password, Ada and John I believe."
Ada,Female,How did you know? Who are you?
Annette,Female,"Annette Birkin. My husband is the man responsible for the creation of the T-Virus, William Birkin."
Ada,Female,What?
Annette,Female,"John’s dead. He became one of those zombies. My condolences. And although I regret this, you will be joining him shortly. I won’t let anyone take the G-Virus away from me."
Ada,Female,G-Virus?
Annette,Female,It’s capable of creating the ultimate bio-weapon. Its potential is even greater than that of the T-Virus.
Ada,Female,That must mean the creature in the police department is...
Annette,Female,Precisely. My husband William. And it is all Umbrella's fault. None of this would have happened if they hadn’t tried to steal his research away from him.
Umbrella Soldier 1,,This way.
William,Male,"Its sheer perfection. My precious G-Virus, no one will ever take you away from me."
Umbrella Soldier 1,,There he is.
William,Male,"So, you’ve finally come."
Umbrella Soldier 2,,"Doctor, we’re here to collect the G-Virus sample."
William,Male,"Sorry, but I won’t just hand over my life’s work."
Umbrella Soldier 1,,Stop it! You might hit the sample.
Umbrella Soldier 2,,"That’s it, all right. Okay, let’s move out."
Annette,Female,"William... Oh, my... Hold on, darling. I’m taking care of that bullet wound first. Stay here."
Umbrella Soldier 1,,"Alpha Team, have you retrieved the sample yet?"
Alpha Team Leader,,Affirmative. Meeting at the rendezvous point in one minute.
Umbrella Soldier 1,,Roger.
Ada,Female,Are you telling me that he injected the G-virus into his own body?
Annette,Female,The G-Virus has the ability to revitalize cellular functions.
Umbrella Soldier 1,,What was that?
Umbrella Soldier 1,,"Something’s wrong, let’s check it out. Over there!"
Umbrella Soldier 2,,I’m stopping it!
Umbrella Soldier 1,,What is this thing?
Umbrella Soldier 2,,No!
Umbrella Soldier 1,,Hurry!
Umbrella Soldier 1,,What is this thing?
Umbrella Soldier 1,,Fire...Fire!
Umbrella Soldier 1,,You Sun of a...!
Ada,Female,So those rats were the carriers of the virus?
Annette,Female,"as a result of his transformation, William should have lost any prior memories he had as a human by now. Even worse, every G-Virus bio-weapon including William has the ability to implant embryos into other creatures."
Ada,Female,And create offspring... No...
Ada,Female,Too bad.
Leon,Male,Ada?
Leon,Male,Ada!
Ada,Female,Leon.
Leon,Male,This bullet wound isn’t making things any easier.
Ada,Female,"Quiet, Leon. I’ll patch you up."
Ada,Female,That’s two I owe you.
Leon,Male,Don’t mention it.
Ada,Female,I just found out. John’s dead.
Leon,Male,What?
Ada,Female,"Never mind. Let’s get out of here, The sooner the better."
Leon,Male,"Ada! Ada... Can you hear me, come on snap out of it."
Leon,Male,"Don’t die on me, Ada. Come on, wake up! Come on!"
Leon,Male,Welcome back.
Leon,Male,"Hey, take it easy. We’re inside Umbrella’s secret lab. I’ll go find something to treat that wound. So just rest here in the meantime."
Ada,Female,But I’ll only slow you down with these injuries. Go and save yourself.
Leon,Male,I told you it’s my job to look out for you.
Ada,Female,"But... You’ll be in danger if you stay with me. I know I’ve only known you for a short period of time, but I really enjoy being with you."
Leon,Male,I’m...
Ada,Female,"I know. I’m not capable of caring about anyone, but... I don’t want to lose you."
Leon,Male,"We’re leaving this place together. Wait here, I’ll be right back."
Annette,Female,"You! You murdered my husband! I know what you’re looking for! You came for the G-Virus didn’t you! You won’t take it from me! This is my husband’s legacy! Now, where’s that spy you were working with earlier, you know who I’m talking about."
Leon,Male,What?
Annette,Female,You really don’t know anything do you! You’re so gullible! She’s one of the operatives sent here by the agency. The only reason why she came here was to obtain the G-Virus.
Leon,Male,That’s a lie.
Annette,Female,"No, it’s the truth. I discovered this when I did a background check on her. She specifically got close to John and became his girlfriend to get information about Umbrella."
Leon,Male,That can’t be! I know her. Ada wouldn’t do something like that!
Annette,Female,"If you don’t want to believe me I don’t care, you're about to die anyway."
Annette,Female,What happened?
Computer,,"The self destruct sequence has been activated! Repeat, the self destruct sequence has been activated! This sequence may not be aborted! All employees proceed to the emergency car at the bottom platform!"
Ada,Female,Leon!
Ada,Female,I’ve been waiting for you Leon.
Leon,Male,What are you doing?
Ada,Female,"You know what this is about, so just hand over the G-Virus!"
Leon,Male,I don’t believe this. Annette was right...about everything.
Ada,Female,"That’s why I told you to leave without me, but you wouldn’t listen! Now, hand it over. Don’t make me shoot you!"
Leon,Male,You can’t do that.
Leon,Male,"Ada... Ada, I’ve got you... Don’t give up."
Annette,Female,G-Virus... G-Virus...
Ada,Female,It's over. Let me go.
Leon,Male,Shut up! You’re gonna make it!
Ada,Female,It’s too late Leon. We both know it.
Leon,Male,No! I promised you we would escape. You just have to help me out here!
Ada,Female,I really wanted to escape with you... Escape from everything... Goodbye.
Leon,Male,Ada!
Leon,Male,No.
Leon,Male,So...This is what everyone’s been dying for.
Claire,Female,Leon... Hurry up! Leon!
Sherry,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,Stay down!
Claire,Female,Are you okay?
Sherry,Female,"Yes, I’m fine."
Leon,Male,It’s finally over.
Claire,Female,No. I have to find my brother.
Leon,Male,You’re right. This is just the beginning.
Leon,Male,"Goodbye, Ada."
Narrator,,"In the midst of the T-Virus outbreak in Raccoon City, Leon Kennedy succeeded in escaping from the city following his encounter with one of the only other survivors, a woman named Ada, a spy seeking the deadly G-Virus. However..."
Leon,Male,Ada!
Narrator,,"Leon was not the sole survivor of the incident. A girl named Claire Redfield was in town on business of her own. She came to uncover the mysterious circumstances of her brother's disappearance, Chris Redfield, a member of the STARS Alpha Team. Only now, her mission has become quite simple. Basic survival within the nightmare that was once Raccoon City."
Claire,Female,I'm finally here.
Truck Driver,,That guy's a maniac! Why’d he bite me?
Claire,Female,Hello? Is anyone here? Hello.
Claire,Female,Uh... hello?
Claire,Female,"Look, I'm sorry I bothered you okay? Just don't come any closer!"
Claire,Female,Are you listening!?
Claire,Female,"Wait, don’t shoot!"
Leon,Male,Get down!
Leon,Male,"We can’t stay out here. Get to the police station, it’ll be a lot safer."
Leon,Male,There!
Leon,Male,Let’s buckle up.
Claire,Female,What’s going on? I arrived in town and the whole place went insane...

Leon,Male,Claire!
Claire,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,I’m okay! Head to the station. I'll meet you there.
Cop,,"Hey! Get over here, hurry!"
Pilot,,I can't set her down! I'll drop you a rope ladder!
Cop,,"Come on, just a little more!"
Cop,,Get off me!
Cop,,"Stay back, don't come any closer!"
Cop,,Stay back!
Claire,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,Good to see you're still among the living. It looks like we’re not going to find your brother here after all.
Leon,Male,"There’s no reason for us to stay any longer than we have to. Let’s split up, look for any survivors and get out of here."
Claire,Female,Right.
Leon,Male,"One last thing, here’s a radio. Take it. That way we can keep in touch if anything happens."
Sherry,Female,Help me!
Irons,Male,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I thought you were another one of those zombies."
Claire,Female,Are you Chief Irons?
Irons,Male,"Yes, that's me. And just who are you? No, don't bother telling me. It makes no difference. You'll end up just like all the others."
Irons,Male,"That's the Mayor's daughter. I was told to look after her, but I failed. Miserably. Just look at her. She was a true beauty. Her skin, nothing short of perfection."
Irons,Male,"But, it will soon putrefy and she will turn into a zombie within the hour like all the others!"
Claire,Female,There must be some way to stop it!
Irons,Male,"In a manner of speaking there is. Either by putting a bullet through her brain, or by decapitating her completely."
Irons,Male,And to think that taxidermy used to be my hobby.
Irons,Male,"But no longer! Please, I'd really like to be alone now."
Claire,Female,Wait!
Sherry,Female,Let me go!
Claire,Female,"Easy, easy there. I'm not a zombie! You're safe now."
Claire,Female,My name's Claire. What's yours?
Sherry,Female,Sherry.
Claire,Female,Do you know where your parents are?
Sherry,Female,"They both work at the Umbrella Chemical Plant, near the city limits."
Claire,Female,The chemical plant? Then what are you doing here?
Sherry,Female,My mom called and told me to go to the police station because it was too dangerous to stay at home.
Claire,Female,"By the look of things I'd say she was probably right, but it's dangerous here as well. You're better off coming with me."
Sherry,Female,"But there's something out there. I don't know what it is, but I saw it! Much larger than any of those zombies and it's coming after me!"
Claire,Female,What was that?
Sherry,Female,"That's what I was telling you about, it's here!"
Claire,Female,"Sherry, wait!"
Claire,Female,"Sherry! I've been looking everywhere for you, I was so worried. We've got to go now honey, okay? If we stay here that monster will find us. Let's go."
Sherry,Female,No! I won't!
Claire,Female,What's the matter? Don't you trust me?
Sherry,Female,"It's not that, Claire. It's because of my daddy. He's over there,  I heard him call my name. Daddy must have been attacked by the monsters, I have to help him!"
Claire,Female,"Wait, Sherry! Don't go alone! Sherry! Sherry!"
Sherry,Female,Claire? Are you there?
Claire,Female,"Sherry, are you okay? Did you find your dad?"
Sherry,Female,"Yes, I'm okay but I couldn't find him, but I did find something else for you. Here."
Claire,Female,"Thanks, sweetie. Now, why don't you come over here? I want you to stay with me."
Sherry,Female,"Claire, I can't reach the ventilation hole any more, but don't worry, I'll find another way. I can take care of myself."
Claire,Female,"Wait, Sherry. Come back! Sherry! Sherry!"
Leon,Male,"Do you read me, Claire? We now have access to the back of the parking lot."
Claire,Female,Got it.
Leon,Male,I'm getting out of here and heading to the sewer. Can you meet me there?
Claire,Female,I'm on my way.
Claire,Female,Sherry! You're okay!
Sherry,Female,"I'm glad to see you're safe, Claire."
Sherry,Female,Claire!
Claire,Female,"I'm going down there. Stay here and wait for me, okay?"
Irons,Male,"So, you've made it this far. Not bad, girl!"
Irons,Male,I'm not letting anyone leave my town. Everyone's gonna die!
Claire,Female,"Calm down, Chief. What happened?"
Irons,Male,Shut up!
Irons,Male,You couldn't possibly understand what's happened. Those monsters from Umbrella have destroyed my beautiful town! How could they do that to me after everything I've done for them?
Claire,Female,"So it's true, you have been working for Umbrella. Then you must know about the G-Virus. What is it? Tell me!"
Irons,Male,"If you must know, it is the agent that can turn humans into the ultimate bio-weapon. Superior to the T-Virus in every way. William Birkin is the genius behind the project."
Claire,Female,William Birkin?
Irons,Male,"I'm sure you've already seen his little girl running around here. Sherry, Isn't it? In case you haven't already figured it out, the monster that's been tearing my precinct apart is yet another product of the G-Virus, the ultimate bio-weapon! Umbrella must be trying to cover its tracks, but if I'm going to go, I'm going to take you with me!"
Irons,Male,What the?
Sherry,Female,Claire! You came back!
Claire,Female,I can't believe that the man who developed the G-Virus is her father.
Sherry,Female,What's the matter?
Claire,Female,"It's nothing, but I think I found a way out of here. We should be able to find someplace safe if we can just make it out of town."
Sherry,Female,But...
Claire,Female,"Don't worry, I'll protect you, but you have to make sure you don't leave my side."
Claire,Female,"Come on, let's get out of here."
Sherry,Female,Claire!
Claire,Female,Run!
Claire,Female,"Sherry, where are you? Sherry!"
Claire,Female,What happened? You're bleeding!
Leon,Male,"I... I ran into this woman who was in trouble. Her name's Ada. Right after that, someone tried to kill me. Nearly succeeded, too. Ada went after the sniper but... I'm worried about her. You've got to find her before something happens."
Claire,Female,But you've been shot!
Leon,Male,I'll be okay. It's Ada I'm worried about.
Claire,Female,Are you all right? What happened?
Annette,Female,Get away from me!
Annette,Female,"You just want my husband's G-Sample, don't you! But no one will take that away from me."
Claire,Female,Husband? Then you must be Annette!
Annette,Female,How... how did you...?
Claire,Female,Don't worry about that. Sherry is lost somewhere in the sewer system. I have to find her.
Annette,Female,What? I told her to go to the Police building! Why is she here? Now Sherry and the G-Virus sample are in danger.
Claire,Female,What did she mean by that? Does Sherry have the G-Sample?
Claire,Female,Sherry! You're okay!
Claire,Female,"Sherry, did your mom give you something called G-Virus? Either a vial or a test tube?"
Sherry,Female,G-Virus? I've never heard of anything like that before.
Claire,Female,"Are you absolutely sure? If you give it to me, I'll hold onto it for safekeeping."
Sherry,Female,But I really don't have anything. It's the truth.
Claire,Female,"Sherry, wait here. I'm going to check it out by myself."
Sherry,Female,"Okay, I'll wait here, but hurry back."
Claire,Female,"Okay, Sherry. Let's go."
Sherry,Female,Claire! What was that?
Claire,Female,Don't worry. Just wait here. I'll go check it out.
Sherry,Female,Isn't this...?
Claire,Female,"That's okay, you keep it. I'm sure it will keep you safe. Wait here for me, okay? I'm going back to look for your mom."
Sherry,Female,"Thanks, Claire. Even though I'm an only child, neither of my parents spent much time with me. Because of their work. But now that you're with me, I finally have someone to rely upon."
Claire,Female,Sherry.
Claire,Female,Sherry? Where is she?
Claire,Female,Annette!
Claire,Female,Where's Sherry?
Claire,Female,But I asked her and she's never even heard of the G-Virus before.
Annette,Female,Which room? Tell me!
Annette,Female,Sherry!
Claire,Female,No! Annette!
Annette,Female,The sample is inside the pendant Sherry's wearing!
Claire,Female,Sherry!
Sherry,Female,"Help me, Claire!"
Claire,Female,The monster wants your pendant! Throw it to me!
Claire,Female,Now run Sherry!
Claire,Female,"Come and get it! I've got what you want! Come on! Here, this is what you're looking for, right?"
Claire,Female,"Fine, then go get it!"
Claire,Female,Sucker!
Computer,,"The self-destruct sequence has been activated! Repeat, the self-destruct sequence has been activated! This sequence may not be aborted! All employees proceed to the emergency car at the bottom platform!"
Claire,Female,"Sherry, where are you? Sherry? Where is she?"
Sherry,Female,Mom! Mom!
Annette,Female,"Sherry. You have to escape. I know I've been a terrible mother, but I still love you."
Sherry,Female,Mom!
Claire,Female,"Sherry, we have to go now."
Claire,Female,"You go and wait here, okay? I'll go and get this thing moving."
Ada,Female,Here!
Claire,Female,Who are you?
Claire,Female,"You lose, big guy!"
Claire,Female,Leon. Hurry up! Leon!
Sherry,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,Stay down!
Claire,Female,Are you okay?
Sherry,Female,"Yes, I’m fine."
Leon,Male,It’s finally over.
Claire,Female,No. I have to find my brother.
Leon,Male,You’re right. This is just the beginning.
Claire,Female,"Ah, my god has protected you. It will always be with you."
Sherry,Female,Claire.
Claire,Female,Sherry.
Leon,Male,What was that?
Computer,,Warning. Biohazardous outbreak imminent. The emergency system has been activated. This train will detonate. Repeat. This train will detonate.
Claire,Female,What's wrong with this thing?
Leon,Male,"I don't know, the door won't open!"
Computer,,Warning. The self-destruct sequence has been activated. Each train compartment will detonate sequentially.
Leon,Male,What?
Sherry,Female,Claire!
Claire,Female,"Leon, stop the train!"
Leon,Male,I can't! The door is locked!
Sherry,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,"Sherry, get back!"
Leon,Male,That's what I call ugly!
Leon,Male,"Claire, where are you?"
Claire,Female,"You don't give up, do you?"
Leon,Male,Sherry? What are you doing?
Sherry,Female,"We have to stop the train, right? I can do it!"
Leon,Male,Sherry!
Leon,Male,"Persistent, aren't you? Come and get me."
Sherry,Female,"Hmm, which one is the right switch? Maybe this one?"
Claire,Female,Sherry!
Sherry,Female,Claire!
Claire,Female,"Press the switch, over there!"
Sherry,Female,Got it!
Leon,Male,I can't hold on much longer!
Leon,Male,Finally!
Sherry,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,Right here. You're both safe.
Leon,Male,"We've gotta get out of here, move it! Go!"
Leon,Male,"That was a close one. That was pretty impressive back there, Sherry."
Sherry,Female,It was nothing. I saw somebody do that on TV once.
Claire,Female,Come on. We've gotta move out.
Leon,Male,Now what's the problem? Is there something following us?
Claire,Female,"Hey, we've still got a job to do."
Leon,Male,Go? You can't mean...
Claire,Female,Chris. I have to find you.

Leon,Male,Get down!
Leon,Male,We can’t stay out here. Head to the police station. It’ll be a lot safer.
Leon,Male,There!
Leon,Male,Buckle up.
Claire,Female,Okay.
Claire,Female,What’s going on? I arrived in town and the whole place went insane.
Leon,Male,Great. The radio’s out!
Claire,Female,"You’re a cop, right?"
Leon,Male,"Yeah, First day on the job. Great, huh? Name's Leon Kennedy. Nice to meet you."
Claire,Female,Mine’s Claire. Claire Redfield. I came to find my brother Chris.
Leon,Male,Hey. Could you open the glove box?
Claire,Female,Sure.
Claire,Female,There’s a gun inside.
Leon,Male,Better take it with you.
Leon,Male,No!
Claire,Female,Look out!
Leon,Male,You okay?
Claire,Female,Still in one piece.
Leon,Male,That maniac’s gonna ram us!
Leon,Male,Claire!
Claire,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,I’m okay! Head to the station. I’ll meet you there.
Kendo,Male,Freeze! Who are you? What are you doing here?
Claire,Female,Don't shoot. I'm a human.
Kendo,Male,"Sorry about that, babe. I thought you were one of them."
Claire,Female,What's going on in this town?
Kendo,Male,Hold on.
Kendo,Male,"I ain't got no clue, darling. By the time I noticed something was wrong, the entire city was infested with zombies. But don't you worry, girly. You'll be safe in here. I'm keeping a close eye on things."
Claire,Female,Hang in there! Are you the only officer left in the building?
Marvin,Male,Who... who are you?
Claire,Female,Claire. Claire Redfield. I'm looking for my brother Chris.
Marvin,Male,"We lost contact with him over ten days ago. Chris, Jill, Barry. Every last STARS team member has disappeared. We should have listened to them."
Claire,Female,What happened?
Marvin,Male,"About 2 months ago, there was this incident involving these zombie-like creatures in a mansion located in the outskirts of this city. Chris and the other STARS members discovered that Umbrella was behind everything. At the risk of their own lives. But no one believed them."
Claire,Female,Are you okay?
Marvin,Male,"Don't worry about me, just rescue the survivors in the other rooms. Here, take this keycard. You should be able to unlock the doors in the hall with this. Now go."
Claire,Female,But...
Marvin,Male,Just go!
Claire,Female,"Okay, just hang in there. I'll be back soon."
Sherry,Female,Help me!
Claire,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,"Claire, you made it!"
Claire,Female,Yeah. Did you see a little girl around here?
Leon,Male,"Yeah, you just missed her. Who is she?"
Claire,Female,"I don't know, but it's too dangerous for her to stay here alone. Leon, I'll go look for her. You go and find us a way out of here."
Leon,Male,"Of course, but before I forget, here's a radio. That way we can keep in touch if something comes up."
Irons,Male,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I thought you were another one of those zombies."
Claire,Female,Are you Chief Irons?
Irons,Male,"Yes, that's me. And just who are you...no don't bother telling me. It makes no difference. You'll end up just like all the others."
Irons,Male,"That's the Mayor's daughter. I was told to look after her, but I failed. Miserably. Just look at her. She was a true beauty. Her skin, nothing short of perfection."
Irons,Male,"But it will soon putrefy, and she will turn into a zombie within the hour like all the others."
Claire,Female,There must be some way to stop it.
Irons,Male,"In a manner of speaking there is. Either by putting a bullet through her brain, or by decapitating her completely."
Irons,Male,And to think that taxidermy used to be my hobby.
Irons,Male,"But no longer! Please, I'd really like to be alone now."
Claire,Female,Wait!
Sherry,Female,Let me go!
Claire,Female,"Easy, easy there. I'm not a zombie. You're safe now."
Claire,Female,"Leon, come in. I've found the girl and I've cleared the wreckage that was blocking the corridor."
Leon,Male,Got it.
Claire,Female,"My name's Claire, what's yours?"
Sherry,Female,Sherry.
Claire,Female,Do you know where your parents are?
Sherry,Female,"They both work at the Umbrella Chemical Plant, near the city limits."
Claire,Female,The chemical plant? Then what are you doing here?
Sherry,Female,My mom called and told me to go to the police station because it was too dangerous to stay at home.
Claire,Female,"By the look of things I'd say she was probably right, but it's dangerous here as well. You're better off coming with me."
Sherry,Female,"But there's something out there. I don't know what it is, but I saw it. Much larger than any of those zombies, and it's coming after me."
Claire,Female,What was that?
Sherry,Female,That's what I was telling you about. It's here!
Claire,Female,"Sherry, wait!"
Claire,Female,"Sherry! I've been looking everywhere for you, I was so worried. We've got to go now, honey. Okay? If we stay here that monster will find us. Let's go."
Sherry,Female,No! I won't!
Claire,Female,What's the matter? Don't you trust me?
Sherry,Female,"It's not that, Claire. It's because of my daddy. He's over there.  I heard him call my name. Daddy must have been attacked by the monsters, I have to help him!"
Claire,Female,"Wait, Sherry. Don't go alone! Sherry! Sherry!"
Sherry,Female,Claire? Are you there?
Claire,Female,"Sherry, are you okay? Did you find your dad?"
Sherry,Female,"Yes, I'm okay, but I couldn't find him, but I did find something else for you. Here."
Claire,Female,"Thanks, sweetie. Now why don't you come over here, I want you to stay with me."
Sherry,Female,"Claire, I can't reach the ventilation hole anymore, but don't worry. I'll find another way. I can take care of myself."
Claire,Female,"Wait, Sherry. Come back! Sherry! Sherry!"
Claire,Female,Sherry! You're okay!
Sherry,Female,"I'm glad to see you're safe, Claire."
Sherry,Female,Claire!
Claire,Female,"I'm going down there. Stay here and wait for me, okay?"
Irons,Male,Help me!
Irons,Male,"So, you've made it this far. Not bad, girl."
Irons,Male,I'm not letting anyone leave my town. Everyone's gonna die!
Claire,Female,"Calm down, Chief. What happened?"
Irons,Male,Shut up!
Irons,Male,You couldn't possibly understand what's happened. Those monsters from Umbrella have destroyed my beautiful town! How could they do that to me after everything I've done for them?
Claire,Female,So it's true. You have been working for Umbrella. Then you must know about the G-Virus. What is it? Tell me!
Irons,Male,"If you must know, it is the agent that can turn humans into the ultimate bio-weapon, superior to the T-Virus in every way. William Birkin is the genius behind the project."
Claire,Female,William Birkin?
Irons,Male,"I'm sure you've already seen his little girl running around here. Sherry? Isn't it? In case you haven't already figured it out, the monster that's been tearing my precinct apart is yet another product of the G-Virus, the ultimate bio-weapon! Umbrella must be trying to cover its tracks, but if I'm going to go, I'm going to take you with me!"
Irons,Male,My chest. Can't... take the pain.
Sherry,Female,Claire! You came back!
Claire,Female,I can't believe that the man who developed the G-Virus is her father.
Sherry,Female,What's the matter?
Claire,Female,"It's nothing, but I think I found a way out of here. We should be able to find someplace safe if we can just make it out of town."
Sherry,Female,But...
Claire,Female,"Don't worry, I'll protect you, but you have to make sure you don't leave my side."
Claire,Female,"Leon, you're still there? We're leaving."
Leon,Male,Are you crazy! The sewers are still crawling with zombies!
Claire,Female,It'll be all right. We found a way to the sewer. Follow us later.
Leon,Male,"Claire! Claire. Wait, wait!"
Claire,Female,"Come on, let's get out of here."
Sherry,Female,Claire!
Claire,Female,Run!
Claire,Female,"Sherry, where are you? Sherry!"
Sherry,Female,"Claire, I'm here!"
Sherry,Female,Claire?
Annette,Female,"Who are you? Another spy sent by Umbrella, right? You're just after my husband's G-Virus, aren't you?"
Claire,Female,Husband? Then you must be Annette.
Annette,Female,What?
Claire,Female,Sherry's wandering around alone in the sewers. You have to help me find her.
Annette,Female,That's impossible. I told her to go to the police station. What is she doing here? William will be after her.
Claire,Female,William?
Annette,Female,That's right. The creature that has been causing all this destruction is none other than my husband.
Umbrella Soldier 1,,This way.
William,Male,"It's sheer perfection. My precious G-Virus, no one will ever take you away from me."
Umbrella Soldier 1,,There he is.
William,Male,So you’ve finally come.
Umbrella Soldier 2,,"Doctor, we’re here to collect the G-Virus sample."
William,Male,"Sorry, but I won’t just hand over my life’s work."
Umbrella Soldier 1,,Stop it! You might hit the sample.
Umbrella Soldier 1,,"That’s it, all right. Okay, let’s move out."
Annette,Female,"William. Oh, my. Hold on, darling. I’m taking care of that bullet wound, first. Stay here."
Umbrella Soldier 1,,"Alpha Team, have you retrieved the sample yet?"
Alpha Team Leader,,Affirmative. Meeting at the Rendezvous point in one minute.
Claire,Female,Are you telling me that he injected the G-virus into his own body?
Annette,Female,The G-Virus has the ability to revitalize cellular functions.
Umbrella Soldier 1,,What was that?
Umbrella Soldier 1,,Something’s wrong. Let’s check it out. Over there!
Umbrella Soldier 3,,I’m stopping it!
Umbrella Soldier 1,,What is this thing?
Umbrella Soldier 3,,No!
Umbrella Soldier 1,,Hurry!
Umbrella Soldier 2,,What is this thing?
Umbrella Soldier 1,,Fire. Fire!
Umbrella Soldier 1,,You son of a...
Claire,Female,So those rats were the carriers of the virus?
Annette,Female,"As a result of his transformation, William should have lost any prior memories he had as a human by now. He'll try to create offspring."
Claire,Female,What?
Annette,Female,Every G-Virus bio-weapon including William has the ability to impregnate embryos into other life forms. That's why he's after Sherry.
Claire,Female,What are you trying to say?
Annette,Female,A body with non-related genetic coding is likely to reject the embryos.
Claire,Female,It's Sherry. You go that way!
Claire,Female,Sherry!
Claire,Female,"Come on, wake up Sherry!"
Sherry,Female,My stomach. It hurts.
Claire,Female,Don't worry. You'll be fine. Come on. Let's go.
Sherry,Female,"Claire, my stomach. My stomach hurts."
Claire,Female,"Hang in there, Sherry. She's burning up. I have to hurry before the embryos pupate."
Claire,Female,Sherry.
Sherry,Female,Claire?
Claire,Female,You're finally awake.
Sherry,Female,Isn't this...?
Claire,Female,"That's okay, you keep it. I'm sure it will keep you safe."
Sherry,Female,"Thank you, Claire. Even though I'm an only child, neither of my parents spent much time with me. Because of their work. I grew up alone. But now that you're with me I finally have someone to rely upon."
Claire,Female,"Sherry. Rest here for me, I'll be right back as soon as I've found the antidote for you."
Claire,Female,Annette!
Annette,Female,You killed William. I'll never forgive you for that.
Claire,Female,Wait!
Annette,Female,"I've just prepared a sample of the G-Virus, and this time, no one will take it from me. This is the most significant piece of research my husband has ever left in my hands."
Claire,Female,"Stop it. Sherry's in serious trouble. William implanted her with his embryos. There's no telling when they'll pupate. If that happens, Sherry won't..."
Annette,Female,What?
Annette,Female,William?
Annette,Female,William! You're alive!
Annette,Female,William... Is alive. He's getting stronger with each skin he casts off. Sherry!
Claire,Female,Tell me what I need to know! How can I save Sherry?
Annette,Female,I have detailed information. Everything you need to know to prepare the antidote is right here.
Annette,Female,"Save my daughter, and tell her I'm sorry I wasn't a better mother."
Annette,Female,Sherry.
Claire,Female,Annette.
Claire,Female,"Leon, we made it."
Leon,Male,"Claire, is that you? Where are you?"
Claire,Female,"I can see you on the monitor. Never mind about that now. Leon, you have to go back and get Sherry. I left her in the security office. Please, you must save her."
Leon,Male,Wait a second. What about you? Where are you going?
Claire,Female,I've got something else to take care of. I'm counting on you.
Leon,Male,Claire. Hurry! Claire!
Claire,Female,Sherry!
Leon,Male,Stay down!
Leon,Male,Sherry's unconscious.
Claire,Female,I have the antidote. If I give it to her...
Leon,Male,"Claire, what's happening?"
Claire,Female,"Not now! Come on, Sherry, wake up! Wake up, please wake up."
Sherry,Female,Claire? Where am I?
Leon,Male,It worked!
Claire,Female,"Oh, Sherry. You're gonna be okay!"
Leon,Male,It's finally over.
Claire,Female,"No, I have to find my brother."
Leon,Male,You're right this is just the beginning.
Claire,Female,"Ah, my god has protected you. It will always be with you."
Sherry,Female,Claire.
Claire,Female,Sherry.
Narrator,,"In the midst of the T-Virus outbreak in Raccoon City, Claire Redfield succeeded in escaping from the city along with one of the only other survivors, a young girl named Sherry. However, behind their escape was the lone survivor of the Raccoon City Police Department, Leon S. Kennedy."
Leon,Male,What have we got here?
Truck Driver,,That guy's a maniac! Why’d he bite me?
Leon,Male,"Man, what a mess! What could have done this?"
Leon,Male,What are these things?
Leon,Male,"All right, that’s far enough! Don’t move!"
Leon,Male,No!
Leon,Male,What’s up with this guy? That was a clean hit!
Claire,Female,Wait! Don’t shoot!
Leon,Male,Get down!
Leon,Male,We can’t stay out here. Get to the police station. It’ll be a lot safer.
Leon,Male,There.
Leon,Male,Buckle up.
Claire,Female,Okay.
Claire,Female,What’s going on? I arrived in town and the whole place went insane.
Leon,Male,Great. The radio’s out.
Claire,Female,"You’re a cop, right?"
Leon,Male,"Yeah, first day on the job. Great, huh? Name's Leon Kennedy. Nice to meet you."
Claire,Female,Mine’s Claire. Claire Redfield. I came to find my brother Chris.
Leon,Male,"Hey, could you open the glove box?"
Claire,Female,Sure.
Claire,Female,There’s a gun inside.
Leon,Male,Better take it with you.
Leon,Male,No!
Claire,Female,Look out!
Leon,Male,Are you okay?
Claire,Female,Still in one piece.
Leon,Male,That maniac’s gonna ram us!
Leon,Male,Claire!
Claire,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,I’m okay! Head to the station. I’ll meet you there.
Cop,,Hey! Get over here! Hurry!
Pilot,,I can't set her down. I'll drop you a rope ladder!
Cop,,"Come on, just a little more!"
Cop,,Get off me!
Cop,,Stay back. Don't come any closer!
Cop,,Stay back!
Leon,Male,"Hey, wait!"
Claire,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,"Claire, you made it!"
Claire,Female,Yeah. Did you see a little girl around here?
Leon,Male,"Yeah, you just missed her. Who is she?"
Claire,Female,"I don't know, but it's too dangerous for her to stay here alone. Leon, I'll go look for her. You go and find us a way out of here."
Leon,Male,"Of course, but before I forget here's a radio. That way we can keep in touch if something comes up."
Ada,Female,"Sorry, but when I saw the uniform I thought you were another zombie."
Leon,Male,Who are you?
Ada,Female,"Ada, Ada Wong."
Leon,Male,And what are you doing here?
Ada,Female,"I’m looking for a guy named Ben. He’s one of those reporter types, always looking for a scoop. I heard he was locked up in the cell block, only there’s a wrecked car barring the entrance. I’ve been trying to find another way inside. If we work together we can move this thing. Will you give me a hand?"
Leon,Male,"Ada, Wait!"
Leon,Male,"Let me guess. You must be Ben, right? Get up now!"
Ben,Male,What do you want? I’m trying to sleep here!
Leon,Male,Is this the guy?
Ada,Female,"Ben, you told the city officials that you knew something about what’s going on. What did you tell them?"
Ben,Male,And who the heck are you?
Ada,Female,"I’m trying to find my boyfriend. His name’s John. He was working for a branch office of Umbrella based in Chicago, but he suddenly disappeared six months ago. I heard rumors he was here in the city."
Ben,Male,"I don’t know anything, and even if I did, why would I want to tell you?"
Leon,Male,"Okay, I say we leave him in here. Anyone know where they put the key to this cell?"
Ben,Male,"I have it right here, officer. But I’m not about to leave this cell. Those zombies aren’t the only things crawling around out there."
Leon,Male,What was that?
Ben,Male,"Like I said, I’m not leaving this cell. There’s a kennel in the back of the building. Inside the kennel is a manhole. Go through and it will lead you to the sewer entrance, but it won’t be easy."
Leon,Male,"Ada, I don't think I've introduced myself yet. My name's Leon. I’m with the RPD. It’s a dead end."
Ada,Female,Do you think we can get upstairs through this shaft? Give me a boost. I’ll go and check.
Ada,Female,How cute. That little girl must have dropped this. I think I'll hold onto it for her.
Ada,Female,"Leon, can you hear me?"
Leon,Male,"Ada, did you find anything?"
Ada,Female,Right here.
Ada,Female,I can’t reach the ventilation hole I’m going to have to find another way around. I’ll catch up with you.
Leon,Male,"What? Ada, wait."
Claire,Female,"Leon, come in. I've found the girl and I've cleared the wreckage that was blocking the corridor."
Leon,Male,Got it.
Ben,Male,No!
Ben,Male,Get Away!
Leon,Male,"Ben! Can you still hear me? Come on, answer me!"
Ben,Male,I don't believe this! I almost got the story!
Leon,Male,Ben?
Ben,Male,"Bitter irony. The chief of police, a co-conspirator."
Ben,Male,Get that scum... Make him pay.
Leon,Male,"Hang in there, Ben."
Ada,Female,Leon.
Leon,Male,"Where are you going, Ada?"
Ada,Female,To the chemical plant. I have a feeling that's where I'll find John.
Leon,Male,"Ada, wait. Hey!"
Claire,Female,"Leon, are you still there? We're leaving."
Leon,Male,Are you crazy? The streets are still crawling with zombies.
Claire,Female,"It'll be okay. Trust me, we found a way to the sewers. Follow us later."
Leon,Male,"Claire. Claire, wait. Wait! Man, why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?"
Leon,Male,Ada! Running off like that was reckless and stupid. Those zombies are everywhere. Not to mention that thing that got Ben.
Ada,Female,"I was there Leon, I know."
Leon,Male,"Look, Ada. As an officer, it’s my job to look out for you. But we’re not going to get through this alive if we don’t work together."
Ada,Female,All right. We’ll do this your way. For now.
Leon,Male,Ada!
Ada,Female,Leon! That woman was... I have to talk to her.
Annette,Female,Don’t move. You’re the one who was with that cop if I remember correctly. Identify yourself.
Ada,Female,Ada. Ada Wong.
Annette,Female,"Ada Wong? I’ve heard that name before. Now I remember. One of the men from Chicago came to assist the T-Virus research. He used his girlfriend’s name as his password, Ada and John I believe."
Ada,Female,How did you know? Who are you?
Annette,Female,"Annette Birkin. My husband is the man responsible for the creation of the T-Virus, William Birkin."
Ada,Female,What?
Annette,Female,"John’s dead. He became one of those zombies. My condolences. And although I regret this, you will be joining him shortly. I won’t let anyone take the G-Virus away from me."
Ada,Female,G-Virus?
Annette,Female,It’s capable of creating the ultimate bio-weapon. Its potential is even greater than that of the T-Virus.
Ada,Female,That must mean the creature in the police department is...
Annette,Female,Precisely. My husband William. And it is all umbrellas’ fault. None of this would have happened if they hadn’t tried to steal his research away from him.
Annette,Female,Where did you get that? That looks exactly like the one I gave Sherry!
Ada,Female,She dropped it. I was just holding on to it for her!
Annette,Female,Liar! Give it back to me!
Ada,Female,Too bad.
Leon,Male,Ada!
Leon,Male,Ada.
Ada,Female,Leon.
Leon,Male,This bullet wound isn’t making things any easier.
Ada,Female,"Quiet, Leon. I’ll patch you up."
Ada,Female,That’s two I owe you.
Leon,Male,Don’t mention it.
Ada,Female,I just found out. John’s dead.
Leon,Male,What?
Ada,Female,"Never mind. Let’s get out of here. The sooner, the better."
Ada,Female,"We've finally arrived, but there must be something here."
Leon,Male,"Come on, let's go."
Leon,Male,"Ada. Ada. Can you hear me? Come on, snap out of it."
Leon,Male,Welcome back.
Leon,Male,"Hey, take it easy. We’re inside Umbrella’s secret lab. I’ll go find something to treat that wound. So just rest here in the meantime."
Ada,Female,But I’ll only slow you down with these injuries. Go and save yourself.
Leon,Male,"Is it just me or does everybody always ignore what I say? I told you, it’s my job to look out for you."
Ada,Female,"But, you’ll be in danger if you stay with me. I know I’ve only known you for a short period of time, but I really enjoy being with you."
Leon,Male,I’m...
Ada,Female,"I know. I’m not capable of caring about anyone, but I don’t want to lose you."
Leon,Male,"We’re leaving this place together. Wait here, I’ll be right back."
Annette,Female,"You! You murdered my husband. I know what you’re looking for. You came for the G-Virus, didn’t you? You won’t take it from me. This is my husband’s legacy! Now, where’s that spy you were working with earlier? You know who I’m talking about."
Leon,Male,What?
Annette,Female,You really don’t know anything do you! You’re so gullible! She’s one of the operatives sent here by the agency. The only reason why she came here was to obtain the G-Virus.
Leon,Male,That’s a lie.
Annette,Female,"No, it’s the truth. I discovered this when I did a background check on her. She specifically got close to John and became his girlfriend to get information about Umbrella."
Leon,Male,That can’t be. I know her. Ada wouldn’t do something like that.
Annette,Female,"If you don’t want to believe me, I don’t care. You're about to die anyway."
Ada,Female,Run!
Leon,Male,Ada!
Leon,Male,Ada!
Ada,Female,"Leon, please. Escape!"
Leon,Male,"No, we're a team. I can't just leave you behind."
Ada,Female,I'm just a woman who fell in love with you. Nothing more.
Leon,Male,Ada. No. Ada!
Computer,,The self-destruct sequence has been activated. Repeat. the self-destruct sequence has been activated. This sequence may not be aborted. All employees proceed to the emergency car at the bottom platform.
Leon,Male,"I will always remember you. Goodbye, Ada."
Claire,Female,"Leon, we made it!"
Leon,Male,"Claire, is that you? Where are you?"
Claire,Female,"I can see you on the monitor. Never mind about that now. Leon, you have to go back and get Sherry. I left her in the security office. Please, you must save her."
Leon,Male,Wait a second. What about you? Where are you going?
Claire,Female,I've got something else to take care of. I'm counting on you.
Leon,Male,Hello? Claire? Are you there? Claire! Security office?
Leon,Male,"Sherry, I've come to get you out of here, Claire's waiting for you."
Sherry,Female,Claire?
Leon,Male,Rest here for a minute. Claire should be back soon.
Ada,Female,"Here, use this!"
Leon,Male,"Ada, is that you? Ada!"
Leon,Male,Game Over.
Leon,Male,Claire. Hurry! Claire!
Claire,Female,Sherry!
Leon,Male,Stay down!
Leon,Male,Sherry's unconscious.
Claire,Female,I have the antidote. If I give it to her...
Leon,Male,"Claire, what's happening?"
Claire,Female,"Not now! Come on, Sherry. Wake up. Wake up. Please, wake up."
Sherry,Female,Claire? Where am I?
Leon,Male,It worked!
Claire,Female,"Oh, Sherry you're gonna be okay!"
Leon,Male,It's finally over.
Claire,Female,"No, I have to find my brother."
Leon,Male,You're right. This is just the beginning.
Leon,Male,"Goodbye, Ada."
Leon,Male,What was that?
Computer,,Warning. Biohazardous outbreak imminent. The emergency system has been activated. This train will detonate. Repeat. This train will detonate.
Leon,Male,What's wrong?
Claire,Female,I don't know. The door won't open.
Computer,,Warning. The self-destruct sequence has been activated. Each train compartment will detonate sequentially.
Claire,Female,No!
Leon,Male,"Claire, stop the train!"
Claire,Female,I can't. The door to the control room is locked!
Sherry,Female,"Claire, what is it?"
Claire,Female,Stay down!
Claire,Female,"Leon, where are you?"
Leon,Male,"You don't give up, do you?"
Claire,Female,Sherry? What are you doing?
Sherry,Female,"We have to stop the train, right? I can do it."
Claire,Female,Come and get me. I'm right here.
Sherry,Female,"Hmm, which one is the right switch? Maybe this one?"
Leon,Male,Sherry!
Sherry,Female,Leon!
Leon,Male,Press the switch over there!
Sherry,Female,Got it!
Claire,Female,Finally.
Leon,Male,Are you all right?
Sherry,Female,I'm okay.
Leon,Male,Where's Claire? Claire? Claire?
Claire,Female,Right here.
Sherry,Female,Claire!
Claire,Female,I guess we all made it.
Claire,Female,"It just won't quit! Come on, we have to get out of here. Run!"
Claire,Female,"So, it's finally over."
Claire,Female,Sherry. You look terrible.
Sherry,Female,No worse than you Claire!
Leon,Male,Come on. Time to leave.
Claire,Female,"Now, what's wrong? Is something following us?"
Leon,Male,We have to go.
Claire,Female,Go? Where?
Leon,Male,Hey. It's up to us to take out Umbrella.
