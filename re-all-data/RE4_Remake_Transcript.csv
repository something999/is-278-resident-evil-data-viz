Monk,,Non-Playable,"Sumergida en el agua purificadora, envuelta en inmaculado y que aquí te ofrecemos. Oh, señor, que la luz de tu gloria la ilumine hacia tu paraíso. Acepta este cordero, muestra tu poder y acógenos en el paraíso, en tu seno inmaculado. ¡Oh, señor!"
Leon,Male,Playable,"(offscreen) September 30, 1998… It's a day I'll never forget. The cop inside me died that day. And that night, Raccoon City was wiped out. Thanks to the bioweapons created by Umbrella. Somehow, I made it out. But too many others...weren't so lucky. I was asked later to join a top-secret government program. Not that I had a choice. The training, the punishing missions nearly killed me. But at least they kept my mind off everything. If I could just forget what happened that night, the pain—even for a second. This time, it can be different. It has to."
Old Policeman,,Non-Playable,"So, tell me, Yanqui (Yankee)… why did you come to this horrible place? As close to nowhere that I've ever seen? (laughs)"
Leon,Male,Playable,Let's just say—looking for someone.
Old Policeman,,Non-Playable,"That someone must be very important, eh? The chief gave the orders himself. Help him, he said."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Well, I'm sure you boys didn't come all the way out here to roast marshmallows. (Old Policeman laughs) ...Or maybe you did."
Old Policeman,,Non-Playable,You have a strange sense of humor. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Just between us. A lot of people have gone missing around here. And it's been that way for a while now.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Well, then...should be just another day in the office, right?"
Old Policeman,,Non-Playable,"I mean, last week there was a search for some missing hikers. (laughs)"
Leon,Male,Playable,I'm sure you'll do your best to help me…
Young Policeman,,Non-Playable,I think this is it.
Old Policeman,,Non-Playable,"Nature calls, eh? I'll be right back."
Old Policeman,,Non-Playable,(In Spanish) Freezing out here.
Young Policeman,,Non-Playable,(In Spanish) You drink the whole bar?
Old Policeman,,Non-Playable,Tssshhr.
Young Policeman,,Non-Playable,You smoke?
Old Policeman,,Non-Playable,(In Spanish) This is one hell of a gloomy place.
Old Policeman,,Non-Playable,(In Spanish) Hey? Anyone there?
Young Policeman,,Non-Playable,He sure is taking his time. Did he fall in? Maybe you better go and take a look?
Young Policeman,,Non-Playable,I'll watch the car. Wouldn't want to get a parking ticket.
Leon,Male,Playable,So much for helping me.
Leon,Male,Playable,How far could he have gone?
Leon,Male,Playable,Anyone home?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Uh, sorry to barge in like this. (In Spanish) I'm looking for a police officer. Did he come this way?"
Leon,Male,Playable,This is not good…
Leon,Male,Playable,"Man, that stinks."
Leon,Male,Playable,I read you! What's your situation!?
Leon,Male,Playable,The hell is going on?
Leon,Male,Playable,What was that?
Leon,Male,Playable,No fucking way!
Leon,Male,Playable,This just keeps getting worse…
Leon,Male,Playable,"Roost, this is Condor One."
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,Hunnigan here. What's your sitrep?
Leon,Male,Playable,The president's daughter—Baby Eagle. It's likely she's in this village.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,"Our intel was correct, then. Well done."
Leon,Male,Playable,Need a location on a nearby lake. She may have been taken there.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,Copy that. I'll see what I can find.
Leon,Male,Playable,Hurry up. Something's happened to the people here. My escorts are—
Leon,Male,Playable,Gotta go. Talk later.
Leon,Male,Playable,I'll let myself out!
Leon,Male,Playable,Holy shit…
Leon,Male,Playable,Here we go.
Leon,Male,Playable,You gotta be kidding me.
Leon,Male,Playable,It's my lucky day.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Oh, nice."
Leon,Male,Playable,You're shitting me!
Leon,Male,Playable,You've gotta be kidding me!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Oh, sorry!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Huh?
Leon,Male,Playable,Where's everyone going? Bingo?
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,Roost to Condor One. I've identified a route to the lake. Look for a large windmill. There's a path on the far side of it.
Leon,Male,Playable,Windmill. Copy that.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,And be careful. Roost out.
Leon,Male,Playable,These people are sick.
Leon,Male,Playable,There it is.
Leon,Male,Playable,Gotta fix everything myself.
Leon,Male,Playable,God damn.
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit!
Leon,Male,Playable,This the place?
Leon,Male,Playable,What's that noise?
Man,Male,Non-Playable,"That hurts, you know?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Seemed like you really wanted to talk.
Man,Male,Non-Playable,"How observant, señor. Now, say—you got a smoke?"
Leon,Male,Playable,"You know, those things will kill you."
Man,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, well, maybe just untie me then?"
Man,Male,Non-Playable,¡Joder! (Fuck!) Not this guy.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Who are you? OK, stop right there!"
Monk,,Non-Playable,Sacrificial lamb. You will receive our most sacred body. It begins now.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Oh, what the fuck?"
Man,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, stop it! Oye, Yanqui (Yankee), got a name?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Leon.
Man,Male,Non-Playable,"Quiet type, eh? I'm Luis Serra. And guess—you, me—picked the wrong spot to vacation, eh?"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, stop it! You move, I move... and I'm beat up enough as it is! I can see your thinking. Bet you've been in spots like this before. My guess… you're here looking for someone? One more guess. Maybe... some missing señorita?"
Leon,Male,Playable,A young girl?
Leon,Male,Playable,Talk. Now.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"All right. See, I heard chatter about moving a señorita."
Leon,Male,Playable,Moving her. Where?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Who knows? But later, saw some men dragging someone… to the old church."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Mierda… Hanging with you? Not healthy—
Leon,Male,Playable,"Hey, we're not done here!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Later, amigo!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit. They took my gear.
Leon,Male,Playable,Condor One to Roost. I've located Baby Eagle. It sounds like she's being kept in some church.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,Great! That's good news.
Leon,Male,Playable,I heard it from this guy I met. Said his name is Luis Serra. There was something fishy about him. I need you run a background check.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,"Wilco, Condor One. I'll see what I can find. In the meantime, make your way to that church."
Leon,Male,Playable,Right. I'm probably due for confession anyway. Condor One out.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Hey, that's my gear."
Leon,Male,Playable,I'll be taking these back.
Man,Male,Non-Playable,"Over here, stranger."
Leon,Male,Playable,Who is that?
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Let's do some business then, ey! Welcome! A job well done deserves payment in kind. Got some rare things on sale, stranger. That's good work if I do say so myself. Pleasant travels. What's that? How have we procured these curiosities? Heheheh, you don't wanna know, mate. Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. A deal well struck, heheh! A bit more space never hurt anyone. Perfect size for you, stranger. Wish your enemies sweet dreams from afar with a bullet straight through their heads, mwahaha! Go on, take this as well. Free of charge! All yours, stranger. So that's a request, done and dusted, eh? Good stuff, mate. Haha, well done! You've proven yourself reliable. Well then. What can I do you for? Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! A wise choice, mate. Its ammo will penetrate just about anything."
Leon,Male,Playable,The hell am I?
Leon,Male,Playable,"All right. Outta the way! Sorry, must've slipped. They keep coming!"
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Hello, stranger. We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend. Good as new. Anything else I can 'elp you with? Come back anytime."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Oh... Break's over, I suppose!"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Well, that stinks."
Leon,Male,Playable,Fuck!
Leon,Male,Playable,Are you even feeling this?
Leon,Male,Playable,Finally.
Leon,Male,Playable,Not too shabby. Someone is showing up their neighbors.
Leon,Male,Playable,Old photos…
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,Your blood has accepted the Gift.
Leon,Male,Playable,Gift… in my blood?
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,Roost to Condor One. I've got that intel you requested on Luis Serra. It seems he used to be a researcher for Umbrella.
Leon,Male,Playable,Umbrella? I should've left him in that bag to rot.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,"I'm sending you the details. Take a look, but Baby Eagle is your priority."
Leon,Male,Playable,Copy that. Making my way to the church. Condor One out.
Leon,Male,Playable,"You too, huh?"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Take care of yourself, buddy."
Leon,Male,Playable,What!?
Leon,Male,Playable,Next?
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"I have some new goods that might interest you. Welcome! Got some rare things on sale, stranger. There's some things money can't buy. You've got a soft spot for treasure, ey? Yeah, that's the way. Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! I knew you were a go-getter! Why not try your hand at a new gun, stranger? Might save your life… Not only will you need cash but you'll need guts to buy that weapon. Information is a commodity these days. Easy work."
Leon,Male,Playable,A church... I made it.
Leon,Male,Playable,Damn it.
Leon,Male,Playable,Condor One to Roost. The church is sealed up.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,And Baby Eagle?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Negative, nothing yet. But they sure do have this place locked up tight."
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,I see. I can think of one reason they'd want to do so.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Oh she's here, that's for sure. I'll find a way in. Condor One out."
Leon,Male,Playable,The lake... Let's hope for no more surprises.
Leon,Male,Playable,They keep coming! Outta the way!
Leon,Male,Playable,Good luck finding someone big enough to use this thing.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"So that's a request, done and dusted, eh? Good stuff, mate."
Leon,Male,Playable,There are enough weapons here to get a party going.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Good stuff, stranger! What can I interest you in? My back is killin' me. Years haven't been kind to us, I suppose. I'll buy almost anything. Well done, stranger! Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! Crossin' your T's, dottin' your I's. That's the way to be. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see… A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill, friend. We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend. Come back anytime. Gun rhymes with fun for a reason, stranger!"
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Welcome, stranger. I believe this is your first time 'aving a go at target practice. There's only one rule—shoot the targets as they pop up. Simple enough, am I right? If you do well, I'll make it worth your while. Knick knacks and whatnot. Anyway, have fun, mate! Rely too much on a single weapon and you'll find yourself out of ammo, mate. Begin! Brilliant! That's the stuff! Superb shot! Reload! Brilliant! That's it! It's a bullet bonanza! Fire everything you've got! That's your lot! A perfect performance!? Are you for real, mate!? Begin! Superb shot! You're an artist, mate! Oh, beautiful! Brilliant! Reload! Double kill! You're an artist, mate! And that's the game! My... I-I'm speechless. Begin! That's the stuff! Reload! You're an artist, mate! Double kill! Brilliant! You've been waitin' for it. A flood of targets! You're an artist, mate! Oh, beautiful! And that's the game! Some of the targets are, well, particularly sturdy. One shot won't be enough for those, I'd wager! Do come again, stranger."
Leon,Male,Playable,Fuck.
Leon,Male,Playable,The hell was that?
Leon,Male,Playable,Looks like there's something over there.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Damn, look at the size of that..."
Leon,Male,Playable,"C'mon, fill the tank when you're done! All right."
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit. God damn it.
Leon,Male,Playable,Huh!
Leon,Male,Playable,One down.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Sorry, must've slipped. Last one. This is what I'm talking about. All right. They keep coming!"
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Ah, I see you took care of a request. Well done. Nice work! Well then. What can I do you for? What's that? How have we procured these curiosities? Heheheh, you don't wanna know, mate. Heheh, a wise choice. I know I say that a lot, but I mean it. Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. Perfect. You're a real professional. Easy work. Moldin' a weapon to suit your specific needs, oho! It's a thing of beauty, innit? Dazzled, are you? Our craftsmanship demands no less. Will that be all, then? Can't sell what I don't have. Don't get yourself killed now, haha."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Think you can swallow me whole, huh?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Where'd you go?
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,"Sacrificial lamb. You will receive our most sacred body. It begins now. When day breaks, you too will join our covenant. To share in my holy blessing… forever."
Leon,Male,Playable,Condor One to Roost. Do you read me?
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,Condor One!? You've been radio silent for three hours. Are you all right?
Leon,Male,Playable,Yeah… I'm fine. Won't let it happen again.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,And the church?
Leon,Male,Playable,Still looking for whatever key I need.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,Copy that. I'm glad you're OK. Roost out.
Leon,Male,Playable,What the...? What the fuck...
Leon,Male,Playable,What is this place? Some kind of shrine? Same mark from the church.
Leon,Male,Playable,Is this the key?
Leon,Male,Playable,It's the lake.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"I have some new goods that might interest you. Welcome! Got some rare things on sale, stranger. You'll get some bang for your buck, I guarantee it. Information is a commodity these days. Without the necessary funds, I'm afraid we don't have a deal! That won't cover it, I'm afraid. Thank you! Will that be all, then? Don't get yourself killed now, haha. A deal well struck, heheh! A decent size. But size ain't everything, am I right? See how that feels, mate. Fella like yourself should notice the difference right away."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ah, it's locked. All right. Here you go! Give me a break already. You're serious?"
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Nothing but the finest wares! Welcome! What can I interest you in? This is what I'm talking about! Fine work! Without the necessary funds, I'm afraid we don't have a deal! Haha, well done! You've proven yourself reliable. Anything else I can 'elp you with? My back is killin' me. Years haven't been kind to us, I suppose. Heheh, a wise choice. I know I say that a lot, but I mean it. Good as new. There you are, as you wished. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see… Well then. What can I do you for? Pleasant travels."
Leon,Male,Playable,Condor One to Roost. I found the key to the church.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,"Copy that. Now, go get Baby Eagle."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Right, no time to chat. I'm going in. Condor One out."
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit.
Leon,Male,Playable,Here you go! Present for you.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Hey, it's that dog. You wanna help? Cause I could use it!"
Leon,Male,Playable,You got worms too?
Leon,Male,Playable,You're kidding me. Shit!
Leon,Male,Playable,That's what I'm talking about! Good boy!
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit! C'mon!
Leon,Male,Playable,"God damn... I was almost a pancake. OK, let's get to that church."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Thanks, bud."
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley Graham!? I'm here to help!
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley? You in there?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ashley? Ashley Graham, are you in here?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Just let me go.
Leon,Male,Playable,Listen.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Easy with that! My name's Leon. I'm here on the president's orders, and—"
Leon,Male,Playable,That went well.
Leon,Male,Playable,Hey. It's dangerous outside. You need to listen to me—
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,What is that? Over there?
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,Pursue them. The lost lambs are escaping. Deliver unto them... salvation.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,What do we do?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Your father trusts me. And I need you to trust me too, and do exactly as I say. I'm gonna get you home safe."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"OK, Leon."
Leon,Male,Playable,"All right, let's get the hell out of here."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Seriously? I just bought this.
Leon,Male,Playable,Get the ladder.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Me? Um, OK."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,What do we do? There's no way out.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,No way.
Leon,Male,Playable,"It's OK. I've got you. Hey, trust me!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Th-Thanks…
Leon,Male,Playable,"Roost, I've secured Baby Eagle."
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,Copy that. Is she OK?
Leon,Male,Playable,Affirmative.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,"Well done, Condor One. I'll dispatch a chopper ASAP. I'm sending you the coordinates for the extraction point. Make your way there. And don't let anything happen to Baby Eagle."
Leon,Male,Playable,Copy that.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,"Hurry, the weather is getting worse. Roost out."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Like I said, it's dangerous. Stay close."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,OK.
Leon,Male,Playable,OK. It's all right. With me.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,OK.
Leon,Male,Playable,You're serious? They're coming. Get behind me!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Oh, god! What is wrong with these people!?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Give me some space.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,OK.
Leon,Male,Playable,Come on!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,No prob.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"I have something I think you'll like. Welcome! Oh, what're ya buyin'? A deal well struck, heheh! Come back anytime."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Hey, can we take a break?"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Sorry, we need to keep moving."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Got it…
Leon,Male,Playable,Hunnigan was right about the weather…
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit! Come on. I need you to open it from the other side. It's open. Good work. Damn! I knew it. Next?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Seriously, this can't be happening..."
Leon,Male,Playable,C'mon! Shit!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Leon, no!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Twisty son of a bitch.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I'm definitely gonna catch a cold.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Hey! Over here! Come on!
Leon,Male,Playable,You!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey... Listen, about earlier, I—"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Yeah, about that…"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Hey. I see you found your missing señorita.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"The señorita has a name, and it's Ashley. And you are?"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Name's Luis. Encantado. (Charmed.)
Leon,Male,Playable,Great. We all have names. Now then—Who are you? And what're you doing here?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Very good questions, unfortunately…"
Leon,Male,Playable,Hide. Now!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"In that case, here, help me."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ashley, quick! Over here! Go!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,OK. It's game time.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Hordes of them against two of us. Oh, and let's not forget—this mob is made up of monsters. You done warming up? Hope you stretched!"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Yeah. Now, if you'd shut up, we'd be good to go."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Lighten up, cowboy."
Leon,Male,Playable,Give me a break already.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"I've been waiting, hero boy! Perfect timing! Give me a hand! One down. It's all you! They keep coming! Look! We've got a big one on our hands!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Little busy at the moment!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, our guests will think we're rude! So much for service with a smile, huh! But I guess bullets work just as well."
Leon,Male,Playable,Stay focused!
Leon,Male,Playable,None left!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Leon! This way, hurry!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley!?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Wh-What's happening to me?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Ashley. Is this the first time you've coughed up blood like this?
Leon,Male,Playable,You wanna start explaining?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"The cough, the blood—it's caused by something called a… plaga. (plague, pest, infestation) OK. You saw those people, right? Well, you have the same thing inside you. The same thing that made them like that. This, what you're experiencing, these symptoms… They're only the beginning."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I don't want to become like them.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"You are, well, lucky. You see, at this early stage, the parasite—the plaga. It is possible to remove it… with a surgical procedure. And all you need is some know-how. And, oh yeah—the right equipment."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Wait. You, too?"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"No worries. See, I have a plan. But you're going to have to trust me."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Great! We're partners then!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Hey, why are you—"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,No time for any questions. The clock is ticking!
Leon,Male,Playable,Why are you helping us?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Because it makes me feel better. Let's leave it at that. I will contact you later.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Hey. Got a smoke?
Ada,Female,Playable,I do. The kind you like. Now where's the Amber?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Unfortunately, it's not on me at the moment. And you really should be telling me what a good job I did."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Busted my ass and managed to hide it right before I got caught. Which is why I'm still alive!
Ada,Female,Playable,"The deal was we get you out of here when you deliver the Amber. No Amber? No protection, Luis."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Such a stickler for details, huh Ada? OK, then. I'll go get it now. How about that?"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,And I do have something else I need to get too.
Leon,Male,Playable,"This is Roost. I've got some bad news, Condor One."
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,"With the weather like this, the chopper can't make its approach. Can you stand by until it clears?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Negative. Too dangerous. We're gonna get out of here and find someplace safe.
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,"I'm sorry, I wish I could do more to help."
Leon,Male,Playable,Don't worry about it. We'll swim home if we have to. Condor One out.
Leon,Male,Playable,Let's go.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,What's... What's gonna happen to me?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Right now, let's just focus on getting out of here."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Yeah. Right.
Leon,Male,Playable,"We've got company. Keep moving, but quietly. Got it?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,OK… I’ll… I’ll try…
Leon,Male,Playable,All right.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,Guess we're doing this!
Leon,Male,Playable,Sure is quiet.
Leon,Male,Playable,Looks like I need something. All right. Won't open...
Leon,Male,Playable,Stay here.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,What!?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,O-OK.
Leon,Male,Playable,Great.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Sorry, didn't realize that was yours."
Leon,Male,Playable,"I am flattered, but I'm a one-lady type of guy."
Leon,Male,Playable,They keep coming! One down.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Leon! Leon, help!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Hey!
Leon,Male,Playable,You hurt? Hang in there!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"No, I'm OK."
Leon,Male,Playable,Come on!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,All right.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Stay down, all right?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Holy...
Leon,Male,Playable,Here you go!
Leon,Male,Playable,Are you hurt?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"No, I'm... I'm OK, I guess."
Leon,Male,Playable,You did well back there. Seems this isn't your first time running from creeps.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I can't tell if that's meant to be a compliment.
Leon,Male,Playable,All right. Come on.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,OK.
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,Your soul requires cleansing.
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,"Come, child."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ashley, run! Hurry!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Nooo!
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,There is no escape.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,Don't worry about them! One down. The bridge!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon! Watch out!
Leon,Male,Playable,This way!
Leon,Male,Playable,You OK?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I'm stuck!
Leon,Male,Playable,We need to go!
Leon,Male,Playable,You gotta be kidding me.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I'm good!
Leon,Male,Playable,Then run!
Leon,Male,Playable,Close one.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Yeah.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Listen. You're the one he wants. If we see him again, you run."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Wh-What about you?
Leon,Male,Playable,I'll do my job.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Be careful.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,Cease your pointless struggling. Abandon your body to the will of our God.
Leon,Male,Playable,"You're a shitty missionary, you know that?"
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, Almighty! Grant me the strength to crush your enemies."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Son of a bitch! Ashley, run!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,OK!
Leon,Male,Playable,Hasta luego! (Goodbye!)
Old Man,Male,Non-Playable,"God, thank you for our gift!"
Leon,Male,Playable,You wanna get ugly? Let's get ugly!
Leon,Male,Playable,That had to have done something.
Leon,Male,Playable,Guess your tapdancing days are over!
Leon,Male,Playable,Back at you!
Leon,Male,Playable,Hey! Watch where you're swinging those things!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Running out of options, huh?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Leon, quick! This place is coming down!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Give my regards to your god.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Hey! You coming? Leon! Hey, come on! It's dangerous! Leon, hurry!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,You're welcome?
Leon,Male,Playable,Thanks. This fire's bound to catch their attention. Let's keep moving.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Uh, Leon? I'm not going to turn into one of them, right?"
Leon,Male,Playable,I won't let that happen. I promise.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,What's going on?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Well, at least we don't have to worry about being followed. Come on."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Hola. Luis here. You guys still around?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Well, I wanted to go home, but Ashley just had to see this castle first."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Perfect, because I have a present I want to give you. Medicine that will help to suppress the progress of your...problem."
Leon,Male,Playable,Where do we go?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Let's see... Come to the courtyard inside of the castle. We can meet up there. ¡Ciao!
Leon,Male,Playable,"All right, Ashley. Luis just said—"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I got it. Guess we better get going?
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Got some new wares, stranger. You're in for a treat. Welcome! I've got something new for you, mate. All my wares are in tip-top shape, I assure you. Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. A deal well struck, heheh! Come back anytime. Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! Heheheheh, thank you. Don't get yourself killed now, haha. Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! Thank you! I see you have an eye for things. Gun's not just about shootin'. It's about reloadin'. You'll know what I'm talkin' about. Come back anytime. Thank you! Let us know when you've made some room. That cash in your pocket or your life? Easy choice, mate. This gun turns heads into pumpkins, mate. Take this for a rampage through the patch, heheh! Come back anytime. Heheheheh, thank you. That's an exemplary firearm right there, stranger. Not the best, sure, but she'll make you an ideal companion. See how that feels, mate. Fella like yourself should notice the difference right away. We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend. I don't always have this in stock, stranger. Pleasant travels."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Huh. Courtyard's gotta be through that gate. Don't think our hosts are gonna roll out the red carpet. What is that? Guessing it's not for decoration.... Crossbows, huh. Something tells me they don't want to be friends. Things just keep getting better."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,What're they—
Leon,Male,Playable,Shh. Keep your voice down.
Leon,Male,Playable,Give me a break already.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,No way! They have catapults!?
Leon,Male,Playable,I guess this is their idea of a warm welcome! You OK?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Yeah.
Leon,Male,Playable,They keep coming! You hurt?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"No, I'm OK."
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit! You're serious? Ashley! You all right?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Yeah, I'm fine."
Leon,Male,Playable,Stay back!
Leon,Male,Playable,Firing again! Come on!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,You got it!
Leon,Male,Playable,All right. That went well.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,A little warning next time!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Wow, look at this place. I mean, it's old but..."
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"So that's a request, done and dusted, eh? Good stuff, mate. Heheheh, I knew I could count on you. Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger! My back is killin' me. Years haven't been kind to us, I suppose. Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. Thank you! Easy work. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see… Don't get yourself killed now, haha."
Salazar,Male,Non-Playable,"A most warm welcome to my castle. Such a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance, Mr. Kennedy."
Leon,Male,Playable,Who—the hell—are you?
Salazar,Male,Non-Playable,"Me? Oh please, call me Ramón. And allow me to get straight to the point. I would like you to hand the girl there, over to me...now."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Yeah, fat chance, Ramón. The girl's just fine. With me."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Never!
Leon,Male,Playable,You heard the lady.
Leon,Male,Playable,Just stay close.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Watch out! You OK?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Yeah, no sweat."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ah, it's locked."
Leon,Male,Playable,Over here.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,‘K.
Leon,Male,Playable,Be careful.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,It's open.
Leon,Male,Playable,Looks like we can continue on this way.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Be careful.
Leon,Male,Playable,Poor bastard... That's no way to go.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Ah! What was that? Do they keep animals down here or something?
Leon,Male,Playable,It can't see me...
Leon,Male,Playable,Gotcha!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Ah! Oh, it's you. What happened down there?"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Nothing. You were right about the animals, though. You OK?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"I'm fine. Well, for now."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Wow... Look at all of this.
Leon,Male,Playable,Won't budge…
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,What's that used for?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Well, it's just a replica. Only a couple uses for it."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,This artwork... Doesn't it look like it's telling some kind of story?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Hang on, this is the same room as before, isn't it? Guess we just circled around."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Leon, what're you doing!?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Don't even think about trying this yourself!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Me? As if!
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Gun rhymes with fun for a reason, stranger! Welcome! Well then. What can I do you for? Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. Thank you! Give that the care it deserves, mate."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Leon! Are you kidding me!? Jumping across chandeliers? Seriously, who does that?"
Leon,Male,Playable,"What're you, my mother?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Not this guy again.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Ugh!
Leon,Male,Playable,No good.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Be careful.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Leon, they're here!"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ah, the entertainment!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon! Watch out!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Out of the way! Come on! Hang on. Not bad, right? Shit!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Put me down!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,You OK?
Leon,Male,Playable,Yeah.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Sorry, must've slipped."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Holy…
Leon,Male,Playable,This is gonna be bright!
Leon,Male,Playable,This should do the trick.
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"All right, awesome!"
Leon,Male,Playable,We're not out of the woods yet.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,A hidden platform?
Leon,Male,Playable,"A little over the top, don't you think?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Come on.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,‘K.
Leon,Male,Playable,You gonna be OK?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Yeah. I-I got this!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,I'll cover you! Don't stop!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,All right.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,All right! Now that one!
Leon,Male,Playable,Be careful!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Leon, watch out!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,Hang on! I've got you!
Leon,Male,Playable,Huh! C'mon! Ashley!
Leon,Male,Playable,All right.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I did it!
Leon,Male,Playable,"OK, get back here!! Hurry up!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,OK!
Leon,Male,Playable,You hurt?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"I'm good, thanks."
Leon,Male,Playable,Over here.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Hey, you sure you're good?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Y-Yeah...
Leon,Male,Playable,Looks like the right place.
Leon,Male,Playable,You OK?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I think so. Uh—
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley!
Leon,Male,Playable,Wait!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Roost, come in! Things went to shit. We took refuge inside a castle, but I've just been separated from Baby Eagle."
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,Say---ding you.
Leon,Male,Playable,Roost? You're breaking up. Do you read me?
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,--dor One! -- in! ---chopper-
Leon,Male,Playable,Damn it. So much for that.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Heheh. Having a rough day, stranger? Welcome! I've got something new for you, mate. Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. Perfect. You're a real professional. Good stuff, stranger! Came into some other bits and bobs too, mate. There's some things money can't buy. Don't worry, I offer repair services as well. Better to be overprepared, am I right? Give that the care it deserves, mate."
Leon,Male,Playable,This is messed up.
Leon,Male,Playable,Is he doing this? Sorry to interrupt! The hell is happening!?
Ada,Female,Playable,"You can stop right there, Leon. Wouldn't make me use this, would you?"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Well after six years, that is one hell of a greeting… Ada."
Ada,Female,Playable,You don't seem surprised. Interesting...
Leon,Male,Playable,Try using knives next time. Better for close encounters.
Ada,Female,Playable,Not a bad move. Very smooth.
Leon,Male,Playable,So who are you working for this time?
Ada,Female,Playable,"Oh, Leon. You know I don't work and tell."
Ada,Female,Playable,Leave the girl. She's lost no matter what. You walk away now… and who knows? Maybe you'll live to meet me again. And then I might get you that greeting you were looking for.
Leon,Male,Playable,You think I'm gonna give up that easy?
Ada,Female,Playable,Right. How about we continue this discussion another time?
Leon,Male,Playable,Last person I thought I'd run into here...
Leon,Male,Playable,"That should do it. All right, need to find Ashley."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Oh, great..."
Leon,Male,Playable,Christ!
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Gun rhymes with fun for a reason, stranger! Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. A deal well struck, heheh! Moldin' a weapon to suit your specific needs, oho! It's a thing of beauty, innit? Crossin' your T's, dottin' your I's. That's the way to be. Dazzled, are you? Our craftsmanship demands no less."
Leon,Male,Playable,She said meeting you once was enough.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Oh, you were expecting me. OK, I think I see how this works."
Leon,Male,Playable,Next?
Leon,Male,Playable,C'mon! Another one? You guys are really starting to become a giant pain in my ass.
Leon,Male,Playable,Outta the way!
Leon,Male,Playable,Yes! A cannon! Hope it works.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Get ready. Adios, you son of a bitch."
Leon,Male,Playable,"All right, open for traffic."
Leon,Male,Playable,Sorry. I've had my fill of you guys.
Leon,Male,Playable,(to himself) Ashley? Where are you?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Stay back! I might hurt you again. I'm so scared. When that happened… I wasn't myself anymore. I was something else.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ashley, that must have been terrifying. I-I know."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,You too?
Leon,Male,Playable,"It's OK to be afraid, you know. But you can't run. You got to keep moving forward. We will beat this. Together."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I don't know if I can.
Leon,Male,Playable,"You can. Just give me a heads-up before you stab me next time, OK?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon… Thanks.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Luis, where are you?"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Sorry I, uh, I screwed up. Come to my rescue, Prince Charming."
Leon,Male,Playable,"I'll show you charming, pal!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,C'mon. I'm in the ballroom past the courtyard. Don't be late to the dance!
Leon,Male,Playable,Can't believe that guy.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"He's in trouble. We can't just leave him, right?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Hey, look! The flag's been lowered!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,You let them out!
Leon,Male,Playable,Easier this way!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Here, hold this down."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Don't leave me! Hey, wait! Leon!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,You OK?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Yeah, no sweat."
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,No prob. Be careful!
Leon,Male,Playable,Now we can finally get out of this maze.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon! They're here!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ashley, run!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Stay away! Stop! Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,Hold on! I'll take care of them! You hurt?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"I'm good, thanks."
Leon,Male,Playable,Ballroom must be this way.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"I've got some new items in stock, heheh. Come, take a look! Welcome! Got something new for ya. That there's pretty big. Enough to get the job done, surely. Thank you! Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. Give that the care it deserves, mate. Good luck to you, stranger. Knife needs care every once in a while. Could be the difference between life and death. Try that on for size. Come back anytime."
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Congratulations! I've prepared a new game for you. I think you'll like this one! Begin! Show 'em what you got! Reload! You're an artist, mate! Don't just shoot everything! Outstanding! That was awesome! That's your lot! You have a knack for this, friend! Now a shotgun—that can cover a lot of area with just one shell. Talk about bang for your buck. Begin! Triple kill! Superb shot! Oh, beautiful! Hah, yeah! Three at once! Reload! No! Not that one! Incredible! Triple kill! It's a bullet bonanza! Fire everything you've got! Very good! Triple kill! That'll do it! I can't believe it. Superb job! Begin! Show 'em what you got! That's the stuff! Brilliant! Reload! You missed. That's not like you. And that's the game!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Nice one, Leon!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Look. There's a statue up there.
Leon,Male,Playable,There's a symbol on the wall. Statue of some snakes...
Leon,Male,Playable,"Huh, a dining hall."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Eat? Here? No thanks...
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,Looks like we figured it out.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Hey, it fits."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,We're sandwiched all right!
Leon,Male,Playable,I'm coming for ya!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Stop! Hey! Up on the balcony!
Leon,Male,Playable,Fuck... I don't feel so...
Leon,Male,Playable,They keep coming!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Leon! Help! Hey, wait! Leon!"
Leon,Male,Playable,"All right, Ashley! Let's move!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Uh, OK!"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ashley, are you all right?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Yeah, thanks."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Looks like we're still missing a piece… Hey Leon, there's some armor. Bet you could use it like a bulletproof vest."
Leon,Male,Playable,Little old fashioned for my taste.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Too bad. I think you'd look pretty dashing.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ashley, stay up there!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,OK! Be careful!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon! The armor!
Leon,Male,Playable,"C'mon, you can't be serious!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Hah!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Look! It stopped moving! I don't think they like the lantern fire!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Take this! Get away from Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Go to hell, you rusty piece of shit!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Hey! Are you OK!?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Yeah! Nighty-night, knights."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Thanks. You sure you're all right? You're not burned, are you?"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Nah, thanks for your help. That really did the trick."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Hehe.
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"You don't think they're gonna move, do you?"
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"A job well done deserves payment in kind. Oh, what're ya buyin'? What's that? How have we procured these curiosities? Heheheh, you don't wanna know. Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. Well, well, I can certainly do something with this. Good as new. Give that the care it deserves, mate. Hello, stranger. Nothing but the finest wares! Welcome! What can I interest you in? Next time buy somethin', ey?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Leon, the stairs!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Stay back!
Leon,Male,Playable,Run! Now!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"I won't run. Wait for me, Leon."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Don't scare me like that…
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Is that a clock? It's broken.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,A hidden staircase? Must lead to a secret room or something.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Keys...
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,No way. It... It stopped?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Which one is it!?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,What now!?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley? Are you OK!?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Hang on, I'll figure something out!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,What's this slot for?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Maybe...
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Yes!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I know I saw another clock like this one...
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"It's all good, nice and slow…"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Get lost! Don't look back. Don't look back.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Come on. Come on!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Oh, thank god. I am done with armor."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Didn't I just say I was done!?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,This sucks!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,The heck…
Leon,Male,Playable,"No, no... No, don't go out! Again!? I've had enough of this!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"OK, be good knights and stay still..."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Almost there!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,All right.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley? Are you all right?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Yeah! Give me a sec, I'll get you out."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Hey! Try this!
Leon,Male,Playable,Can you make it down? I can catch you.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Yeah, I think so."
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley!
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit!
Ada,Female,Playable,Sorry. Nothing yet. But my little helper is creating quite the commotion. Everything will work out just fine.
Ada,Female,Playable,He's a good boy. Predictable.
Ada,Female,Playable,Leon. Changed your mind yet?
Leon,Male,Playable,Ada?
Ada,Female,Playable,"Assuming you haven't, I've got a tip for you. Seems like something big is about to go down in the throne room. Babysitting's tough, huh."
Leon,Male,Playable,Hey! Ada? Ada! ...Perfect. Same as ever...
Leon,Male,Playable,"All right, time to get medieval on your asses. C'mon! Present for you."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Yeah, that's right."
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Nice work! I've got something new for you, mate. What's that? How have we procured these curiosities? Heheheh, you don't wanna know, mate. Got something new for ya. Heheheheh, thank you. There you are, as you wished. A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill, friend. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see… Ah... I'll buy it at a high price. Knife needs care every once in a while. Could be the difference between life and death. You'll be shooting off some nasty fireworks in quick succession with that! Try that on for size. See how that feels, mate. Fella like yourself should notice the difference right away."
Leon,Male,Playable,Fucking monsters…
Leon,Male,Playable,"They keep coming! Wow Ramón, you are really slacking on your pest control."
Leon,Male,Playable,Throne room... This the way?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Great, there's two of them."
Leon,Male,Playable,Gotcha!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Nooo! No!
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon! Stop! No! Don't come any closer!
Leon,Male,Playable,Are you hurt?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Watch out!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,No! No! Please! Let me go!
Leon,Male,Playable,You sick—
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Hang in there, Ashley. I'm coming for you."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Gave up the ghost, huh?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Talk about sticking the landing.
Leon,Male,Playable,The hell—!?
Leon,Male,Playable,Give me a break.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Gun rhymes with fun for a reason, stranger! A deal well struck, heheh! Come back anytime. Welcome! Oho! You'll cut through the crowd with that right there. Knife needs care every once in a while. Could be the difference between life and death. Dazzled, are you? Our craftsmanship demands no less."
Leon,Male,Playable,Fuck! Not good!
Leon,Male,Playable,These people are not right.
Leon,Male,Playable,Something wrong with the power?
Leon,Male,Playable,You're kidding me… You! You're Ramón's lapdog!
Leon,Male,Playable,Frozen's a good look for you.
Leon,Male,Playable,Outta the way! Eat this! C'mon!
Leon,Male,Playable,Looks like it's gonna take more than that.
Leon,Male,Playable,What's your move?
Leon,Male,Playable,I think you need to chill out!
Leon,Male,Playable,"How's that? Hits different, huh!"
Leon,Male,Playable,"So we're playing hide-and-seek, is that it?"
Leon,Male,Playable,You son of a bitch!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Finally, some peace and quiet. My condolences to your master."
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,"Pitiful little lamb. Your suffering can end. Just as it has for our newest daughter. Who has joined us in communion. And now, she is of our flesh.... of our blood. My faithful disciple will show her the path. Go now! Deliver to these vagrant children their salvation."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,I'll make it cheap for you.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Feeling better?
Leon,Male,Playable,Yeah. Seems like it worked.
Leon,Male,Playable,Bad news?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,All we've done is buy you some time. The suppressant's effects will wear off all too soon.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,You ready to go?
Leon,Male,Playable,Don't worry about me. Ashley is the priority.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"In that case, we know what we have to do. Then come, Sancho Panza!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Let us rescue the Princess Dulcinea!
Leon,Male,Playable,You're gonna hurt yourself!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey! That was my lance! OK, we hurry! I get it!"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Why help me, though? What's in it for you?"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"No need to be suspicious! I said I'd help you, didn't I?"
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"There you are! We got a new game for you, stranger. You're gonna take 'er for a spin, right? Targets don't just stick around forever, ey? Don't let the small fry distract you from the big fish! Begin!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,That was dirty.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Oh, beautiful! That's the stuff! Reload! You're an artist, mate! Heheheh! Let the bonus time begin! Bonus targets! Hard to turn that down! Brilliant! C'mon! And that's the game! Not every day I see a performance like that. You're something else, you are! Begin! Triple kill! That's it! You're an artist, mate!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Makin' it look easy!
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Sorry mate, that's a penalty. Reload!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, a double. Nice."
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Double kill! That's your lot! Some of the targets are, well, particularly sturdy. One shot won't be enough for those, I'd wager! Begin!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Don't go easy just because it's a game.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Oh, beautiful!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,A triple!? Look at this guy!
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Reload! You're an artist, mate! Double kill! That's it! Incredible! Very good! Double kill! And that's the game!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Good work. Good shootin', cowboy. I had fun just watching you work."
Leon,Male,Playable,Little hard to put my faith in someone who used to work for Umbrella.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"So you heard, huh? Umbrella's done for. You don't need to worry about them anymore."
Leon,Male,Playable,You didn't answer my question. What are you after?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,I just wanna feel good about myself. Make amends. Or something like that.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Looks like we've got company. What do you wanna do?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,¡Cuidado! (Watch out!) The ones with chainsaws are no joke!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Believe me, I know!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Not bad, right?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Huh! Outta the way! That was not easy.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Time to shine!
Leon,Male,Playable,Aren't you full of surprises?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Leave it to me!
Leon,Male,Playable,Not bad.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,You got this!
Leon,Male,Playable,Sure thing!
Leon,Male,Playable,I bet I could use this.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Dynamite, huh? Nice find, my friend."
Leon,Male,Playable,Yeah. Should make quick work of that dead end.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,¡Dios mío! Give me a heads-up next time!
Leon,Male,Playable,You handle yourself pretty well… You sure you're just a researcher?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,I'm just an average guy who happens to be quite the ladies' man.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"After you, I insist."
Leon,Male,Playable,Such a gentleman.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Hey!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Now you owe me!
Leon,Male,Playable,Luis! Heads up!
Leon,Male,Playable,Now we're even.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Is it always like this with you?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Two of them. One for each of us! Leave this one to me!
Leon,Male,Playable,This other one's not gonna be easy.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Ugh! It moved! Sorry, keep our friend busy for me!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Where do you think you're going?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Leon! Over here!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,What are you doing!? Hurry up!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Delivery!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Heh! Got a little present, just for you!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Leon, shoot it!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Beautiful! Just as planned! All right, let's finish this guy off!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Perfect timing! ¡Oye! I think we can get through here!
Leon,Male,Playable,Come on.
Leon,Male,Playable,How's it look?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,There. It's open.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Well, that was a pain."
Leon,Male,Playable,"They're keeping those things cooped up down here, too?"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"The underground here is sacred to them. See, this is where they discovered las plagas. Preserved inside ancient deposits of amber."
Leon,Male,Playable,Of course they did.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,You're not suggesting we ride this thing? Do you see any other way?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Give us a push, Sancho!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Who're you calling Sancho?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"There, it's moving. This should speed things up a bit."
Leon,Male,Playable,I can't believe I'm doing this.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, we're in a hurry, right? Oh, by the way…"
Leon,Male,Playable,What now?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Hope you like thrill rides.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"We're going off the rails! Lean! ¡Mierda! Do something about those boards! ¡Oye! Switch tracks! If we don't, we're gonna crash! We're going off the rails! Give me a hand!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,It's them! Watch out! Up ahead! Shoot the boards!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Finally some peace and quiet.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Left turn! We're curving to the right!
Leon,Male,Playable,This it?
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Afraid not. Things are just getting started.
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"All right, let's go."
Leon,Male,Playable,Not this again…
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Hey! The cart's tipping over!
Leon,Male,Playable,We've got trouble.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Haha! This is kind of fun! We're going off the rails! Give me a hand! Left turn! Shit! This thing's gonna flip!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Not looking so good. I hope the cart holds up… This thing's in bad shape. Take better care of it, OK?"
Leon,Male,Playable,"End of the line, asshole!"
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,We're going off the rails! Give me a hand! Hey! The cart's tipping over! Look! You can see where they dug up the bugs! Ahead!
Leon,Male,Playable,You're kidding… Get the brake!
Leon,Male,Playable,What!? Are you serious!? Jump!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,¡Oye!
Leon,Male,Playable,Luis!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Can I get a hand? Give us a 3, 2, 1 next time, eh Sancho."
Leon,Male,Playable,Whatever.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, man... Hm, but actually this works. Oye. Let's get on that lift."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,No way. Give me a break.
Leon,Male,Playable,We can make it if we circle around. Come on.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Pain in my ass…
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Ah! I knew it! Stay sharp! These guys have camouflage!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,You got this!
Leon,Male,Playable,One down.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,It's all you!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"I hate insects! Take care of them for me, would ya?"
Leon,Male,Playable,How about you open fire instead of your mouth!
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Hey, I'm the brains. You're the brawn."
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Ah, I see you took care of a request. Well done. Thank you! Pleasant travels. A deal well struck, heheh! Good luck to you, stranger. That's good work if I do say so myself."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Whew. I'm beat. Makes you appreciate tech like this.
Leon,Male,Playable,I don't get you. Why risk your life like this? You don't know us.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,I told you. It makes me feel better.
Leon,Male,Playable,Be straight with me for once.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Los Iluminados... I was working for them.
Leon,Male,Playable,See? There you go.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Helping the two of you.doesn't make up for it. I know that. But still...I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
Leon,Male,Playable,"In that case, you better get serious."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Harsh words for a squire.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"We're out of that hellhole! The fresh air is calling our names! Because if we made it all this way, you know it means we're almost—"
Leon,Male,Playable,Almost what?
Leon,Male,Playable,Luis!
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"Long time no see, rookie."
Leon,Male,Playable,Major Krauser? What the hell? Why?
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,Recovering stolen goods.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,And killing a few rats along the way. Easy work.
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley... It was you.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,You catch on quick. Didn't I teach you? Knives are faster.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,Not bad.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"We are just getting started, rookie."
Leon,Male,Playable,Are you being controlled by that cult!?
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,This has nothing to do with them. I'm a free man who made a choice.
Leon,Male,Playable,Major! You're not thinking straight!
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh, my mind's clearer than it's ever been. Now focus and show me what you've got."
Leon,Male,Playable,A soldier like you? Why would you work for these freaks?
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,Why? Have you forgotten what happened two years ago?
Leon,Male,Playable,Operation Javier?
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,Haven't you learned anything these last two years? They killed us all. Without honor. Without mercy. Only devastating power! What's wrong with wanting the same for myself?
Leon,Male,Playable,Krauser! I can understand. What happened was...unforgivable. But that doesn't give you the right to hurt innocent people!
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,You're still a kid holding on to fantasies of what's right and wrong. Too slow! What's wrong? Not looking too steady.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"Enough play, rookie. You haven't changed a damn bit. What a disappointment."
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"Not looking good, eh, my friend? And such a loss to the ladies of the world."
Leon,Male,Playable,Don't talk.
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,Take this. The key to my laboratory. Go there… and remove those damn… parasites… Help… Ashley…
Luis,Male,Non-Playable,"You know, I led a pretty shitty life. But now, eh… ...what do you think, Leon? People can change, right?"
Leon,Male,Playable,"You were a fine knight, Don Quixote."
Leon,Male,Playable,"You won't get away with this, Krauser."
Ada,Female,Playable,"Leon. There's only time to say this once, so listen up. They took your friend to the top of the clock tower. If you hurry, you might get there before she turns into one of them."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ah, so you aren't heartless after all. I guess I should be...thankful?"
Ada,Female,Playable,"Yeah, you should."
Leon,Male,Playable,"There's the clock tower. Hang in there, Ashley."
Leon,Male,Playable,You really know how to make someone feel welcome.
Leon,Male,Playable,A lift. How thoughtful.
Leon,Male,Playable,"You don't give up, do you?"
Leon,Male,Playable,What!? The lift!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Sorry! Lift's taken! All right. Shit, my body armor!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley! That son of a bitch.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"You have the stench of battle on you, mate. Heheh. Welcome! Well then. What can I do you for? Stocking up while you can? Wise choice. A deal well struck, heheh! Good as new. Crossin' your T's, dottin' your I's. That's the way to be. There you are, as you wished. Will that be all, then? Don't get yourself killed now, haha. Nothing but the finest wares!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,You talk too much.
Leon,Male,Playable,Leave me out of your crappy script.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Watch your language, my lord. What would others think of you?"
Leon,Male,Playable,I will send you back to the hell you came from!
Leon,Male,Playable,I'm gonna shut that mouth of yours for you.
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley... No time to lose.
Leon,Male,Playable,Krauser… Where do you think you're taking her?
Leon,Male,Playable,Perfect. Won't have to swim after all.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ah, damn it."
Ada,Female,Playable,Looking for something?
Ada,Female,Playable,You look like you've got something to say.
Leon,Male,Playable,"I've something to ask you… but I don't think I'll get a straight answer. Raccoon City. You know, after the incident. The world changed. You try to save one person; a hundred others die. I guess I changed too."
Ada,Female,Playable,You? Leon S. Kennedy? You haven't changed. You just think you have.
Leon,Male,Playable,"So here's my question… Have you changed, Ada? Or are you just trying to use me again?"
Ada,Female,Playable,What do you think? We're here.
Ada,Female,Playable,"Don't think too hard, handsome. See you later."
Leon,Male,Playable,Story of my life.
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley. There you are. Spotlights... Let's avoid those. Look at all these busy bees. Better watch my step if I don't want to get stung.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"I've got some new items in stock, heheh. Come, take a look! Welcome! Got some rare things on sale, stranger. That cash in your pocket or your life? Easy choice, mate..Easy work. Heheheheh, thank you. Pleasant travels."
Leon,Male,Playable,Damn it!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Sorry, must've slipped. Not bad, right? Next? Outta the way! They keep coming! A rocket launcher!? This isn't good!"
Leon,Male,Playable,This where they're keeping Ashley?
Leon,Male,Playable,You're serious? Give me a break already. Doesn't look like I can get in through here. Need to find another way.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ashley! Ashley! Come on, Ashley! Wake up! Shit!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Need a keycard.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Oh... Break's over, I suppose! Bigger is better, as they say. Least, I thought so when I was a lad...heheh. Crossin' your T's, dottin' your I's. That's the way to be. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see… Pleasant travels."
Leon,Male,Playable,Christ... What kind of experiments are they doing here?
Leon,Male,Playable,...The fuck are you?
Leon,Male,Playable,Present for you.
Leon,Male,Playable,C'mon!
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit! Again!?
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley!
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit.
Leon,Male,Playable,You're gonna be OK.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon?
Leon,Male,Playable,Sorry I'm late.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,No. Thank you. You brought the medicine just in time.
Leon,Male,Playable,Can you stand?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Where's Luis?
Leon,Male,Playable,He was worried about you...until the end.
Leon,Male,Playable,Come on. We don't have much time. Let's get rid of these things.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,For Luis.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ada, come in. There's a lab where we can remove the parasites. Had a crazy hunch that you'd know where it is."
Ada,Female,Playable,Their most important facilities are housed in their sanctuary at the top of the mountain. That's where I'd look.
Leon,Male,Playable,Huh. Ada the encyclopedia.
Ada,Female,Playable,Happy to help. Now you owe me.
Leon,Male,Playable,You got it?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Pfft, duh!"
Leon,Male,Playable,I'm counting on ya.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I'm pretty much a master of unlocking!
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Got some new wares, stranger. You're in for a treat. Welcome! Got something new for ya. Easy work. Good luck to you, stranger. Come back anytime. Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave..Heheheheh, thank you. This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little bit goes a long way. You'll see…"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Let's find another way.
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley! You OK?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Yeah.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Watch out!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Awesome!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Be careful.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Give me a warning next time!
Leon,Male,Playable,You're serious?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Here, hold this down."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,'K.
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Get off me!
Leon,Male,Playable,Hey!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Thanks.
Leon,Male,Playable,Anytime.
Leon,Male,Playable,Smells pretty bad. You OK?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Yeah. Before, this would have killed me, though."
Leon,Male,Playable,"We go at the same time, yeah?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Got it!
Leon,Male,Playable,OK. We go at the same time.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Yeah, OK. Yeah!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Wait here.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,No prob.
Leon,Male,Playable,What the fuck!?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Die, you stubborn son of a bitch!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Jesus. Cuddly bastard.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"You're not hurt, are you?"
Leon,Male,Playable,"No, I'm good. Get that lever."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,OK.
Leon,Male,Playable,No power.
Leon,Male,Playable,Get this for me!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leave it to me! I'm actually pretty good at this stuff.
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley! Damn it!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Get real! Jerk! Over here!
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Get off me!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Ashley, are you all right?"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Yeah, thanks."
Leon,Male,Playable,Thanks.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,You're welcome.
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"So that's a request, done and dusted, eh? Good stuff, mate. Well look at you, mate! Oh, what're ya buyin'? So, which weapon will you be givin' a shine to? Give us a shout when you want to tune it up. Well then. What can I do you for? I'll buy almost anything. Ah... I'll buy it at a high price. You'll get some bang for your buck, I guarantee it. Stocking up while you can? Wise choice. I don't always have this in stock, stranger. Good as new. Easy work. Where you gonna put this, your pocket!?.Honestly, this might be the only gun you need… Hard times, mate… Nice catch."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon! Look.
Leon,Male,Playable,That the lift?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,If we could do something about this wall…
Leon,Male,Playable,A wrecking ball.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I got this!
Leon,Male,Playable,Hey! You're serious?
Leon,Male,Playable,Is this what they teach kids in school these days?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Have you never heard of driver's ed? Get back!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon!
Leon,Male,Playable,Leave our friends to me!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon! Here we go! It's gonna take more than that. One more time! Take this! Come on! Break you freaking wall! Here we go! The hole's getting bigger! Almost there!
Leon,Male,Playable,"If you all want a beating that bad, I'm happy to oblige. Outta the way!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Yeah! That did it! Did you see me? That was awesome!
Leon,Male,Playable,I think you might have found your calling.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"You know, I... I was thinking—we work well together, don't we?"
Leon,Male,Playable,I guess so.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Right!? Maybe someday, I'll become an agent like you? What do you think? We could protect the US from any and all threats!"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Is that right? Well, either way, first we have to make it out of here."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Hm, you're no fun."
Leon,Male,Playable,This must be what Luis was talking about.
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,"Prostrate yourselves! This is our Holy Body. Our divine providence! And soon… such a profound blessing for all...las plagas! Welcome, my children. I am Osmund Saddler. The speaker for our Lord."
Leon,Male,Playable,Tell someone who gives a shit.
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,Foolish lambs. Why do you deny grace?
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,"Now, abandon your body! Obey. Obey the voice of our Lord."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,No… no! Stop! No!
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,"Sweet child, do not resist!"
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,"Pray, forgive these wicked sinners. My faithful disciple shall deliver to you your...penance. Now child, you need not be afraid. Submit your body and release yourself from fear!"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Saddler, you bastard!"
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"(recorded) You've done well to make it this far, rookie. I've prepared a battlefield up ahead, just for us soldiers. Watered by the blood of generations, hundreds of years, the perfect place to put an end to what happened two years ago."
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Nothing but the finest wares! Welcome! Oh, what're ya buyin'? I'll buy almost anything. Stranger! Oooh, I'll pay a pretty penny for that. What can I interest you in? Let us know when you've made some room. Not my place to say, really, but sometimes things are more interesting if you keep a level playing field, don't you find? Pleasant travels. Easy work. Good as new. See how that feels, mate. Fella like yourself should notice the difference right away. Anything else I can 'elp you with? Come back anytime."
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"I've been waiting for you, rookie. Oh, worried about the girl, is that it? Hmm, that's just like you. You always had poor judgment. But if you think I'm going to let you out of here alive… you're even more naive than I thought. You can't save her. You can't save anyone!"
Leon,Male,Playable,"Give it up, Krauser! Being a lackey for these maniacs… won't bring your men back. And what the hell for? Revenge on the government? You think they would want that?"
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,Revenge? You think I'm doing all this… for revenge?
Leon,Male,Playable,Isn't that what this is all about?
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"You see, in that jungle, I had a revelation. The most important thing in this world is pure, unadulterated power! Los Iluminados have given me that."
Leon,Male,Playable,"You know, you were always an asshole. But at least you had some kind of code, some honor! And look at you now."
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"Enough reminiscing. Move out and draw fire, soldier."
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"Better run, rookie!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Not like I have a choice.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,What's wrong? Show no mercy! Where's your instinct!? You're slow. And so goddamn weak. Guess I'll make the first move! Way too slow! I don't remember teaching you to move like that.
Leon,Male,Playable,But you did teach me never to match the enemy's pace.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"Don't stop moving, soldier! You better hustle. Who knows what's become of the girl."
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,You remember the fight in the jungle? We barely made it out alive.
Leon,Male,Playable,Go with your gut! Don't think! That was the first thing you taught me. He's turned this place into one big trap. I can't fight him on his terms.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"Ready to die, rookie? I'm no stranger to covert tactics, remember?"
Leon,Male,Playable,How could I forget! Shit!
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"I love a good hunt! Still alive, huh? You got lucky! I admit—you've done well to stay alive this long."
Leon,Male,Playable,I'd be dead if I kept listening to people like you!
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,The reaper comes for cowards and the careless alike. Which are you?
Leon,Male,Playable,"I dunno. Guess I'll ask when I see him. Well, you've really gone all out for me. You shouldn't have!"
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"You've passed with flying colors. Here's your medal! This is it, soldier!"
Leon,Male,Playable,You're really doing this? It's not too late!
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"You and me are two sides of the same coin. I guess that means we'll never see eye to eye. You've made it all this way, but you haven't learned a thing! I have to say, I'm disappointed."
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"From you, I take that as a compliment."
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,You and I have chosen different paths. All that's left now is to settle this the old-fashioned way.
Leon,Male,Playable,"I was thinking the same thing, Krauser. Let's finish this, Krauser."
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,Shut your mouth! You wouldn't want to die with it open! You can't beat me!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Are we done here, Krauser? I told you again and again… You're too soft to do what's necessary."
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"That's the difference between you and me, rookie."
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,Time to finish… your training.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,Witness the power!
Leon,Male,Playable,"You've lost it completely, Krauser."
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,Here I come!
Leon,Male,Playable,"So that's your true power? Oh, I'd ask for a refund."
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,You're gonna regret that smart mouth of yours. You're not getting away! I can't wait to see you writhe!
Leon,Male,Playable,Shit!
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,Training's not done. Last lesson starts right now.
Leon,Male,Playable,Nah. Time for the teacher to be taught.
Leon,Male,Playable,"Such confidence. Bring it, rookie!"
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"Are you ready, rookie?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Yeah. Let's settle this.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"I'm not surprised you made it this far! Not bad, but I didn't expect anything less. After all, I know your potential better than anyone. It's a damn shame you can't see the truth. How long do you plan to fight in that primitive body of yours?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Until the mission's finished. You'd have said the same once.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,You need to stop living in the past. Give up! My strength is without equal! Strength is everything. The weak can protect nothing!
Leon,Male,Playable,"The way you're going, there won't be anything left to protect! You'd have known that once!"
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,That's where you're wrong! I didn't know a damn thing! Now I do! You can't deny this power! Imagine the strength you'd have!
Leon,Male,Playable,And turn into a freak like you? You gotta be out of your mind!
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,"Always trying to get the last word. Come here, I'll beat that out of you. Hahaha... Yes! This is the moment I've been waiting for!"
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,Do...what you have to do.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,That's right.
Krauser,Male,Non-Playable,I trained you well… Leon.
Leon,Male,Playable,"That you did, Major. That you did."
Leon,Male,Playable,Their defenses are no joke. That's gotta be their sanctuary. Ashley!
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Oh... Break's over, I suppose! Welcome! Oh, what're ya buyin'? Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, well, that's our choice to make. Heheheheh, thank you. Don't get yourself killed now, haha. Knife needs care every once in a while. Could be the difference between life and death. See how that feels, mate. Fella like yourself should notice the difference right away. Easy work. There you are, as you wished."
Leon,Male,Playable,What was that!?
Loudspeaker,,Non-Playable,"Sorry, bad traffic! One combat chopper, compliments of Hunnigan! Call me Mike. Now let's show these assholes what we got!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Hunnigan... I owe you one.
Mike,Male,Non-Playable,"Oh yeah, more customers! Lure them into an open area! I'll give them what they came for!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Damn it! They keep coming!
Mike,Male,Non-Playable,"Jackpot! All right, go go go! Leave the area up ahead to me! Take break...before you join in on the fun! Hell yeah! What can I say, I never miss!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Huh! Not bad at all!
Mike,Male,Non-Playable,"Twisty son of a bitch. Oh shit, an AA gun! That's gonna be a problem. Hey, tough guy, do something about that turret! I needed to take a piss anyway."
Leon,Male,Playable,Better give him what he wants.
Mike,Male,Non-Playable,"Hurry up and do something about that gun, would ya!"
Leon,Male,Playable,Give me a break already.
Leon,Male,Playable,Time for a taste of your own medicine.
Leon,Male,Playable,Mike! All clear!
Mike,Male,Non-Playable,"Thanks, buddy! All right, now watch me do my thing! Gate's open! Go get rowdy! Bad news—I'm out of ammo! You'll have to handle this one on your own! Don't worry, you got this! I bet you won't even break a sweat!"
Leon,Male,Playable,All right.
Mike,Male,Non-Playable,Get in!
Leon,Male,Playable,Thanks!
Mike,Male,Non-Playable,"When we get out of here, drinks are on me. I know a good bar."
Mike,Male,Non-Playable,"Yeah, keep your head down! Nice and slow. What the—!?"
Leon,Male,Playable,No...Mike!
Leon,Male,Playable,Saddler!
Leon,Male,Playable,"I'll make sure you're the next to go, Saddler. They keep coming!"
Leon,Male,Playable,What the…
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Nothing but the finest wares! Welcome! What can I interest you in? Better to be overprepared, am I right? Pleasant travels."
Leon,Male,Playable,"Almost there... Ashley, I'm coming."
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley!
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,"You have come, my child."
Leon,Male,Playable,What...do you want?
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,"I simply wish to share this gift with as many as possible. A humble wish, don't you think? You see, we are all connected through the Holy Body. And now your flesh and bones, your very thoughts… are already one with us."
Leon,Male,Playable,Bullshit.
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,Why do you reject serenity? When you need only accept the sacred gift? Like...she did.
Leon,Male,Playable,Saddler!
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,"Ah yes. The time has come… for this lamb to join our covenant! Oh, blessings unto him and the sweet mercy they bring. Exult all—and let it be so!"
Ada,Female,Playable,Leon! Go!
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley... Ashley? Damn it.
Leon,Male,Playable,Laboratory B... Looks like it's this way.
Leon,Male,Playable,The hell?
Leon,Male,Playable,Fuck. I'm losing it.
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,"(via telepathy) Still you resist, child."
Leon,Male,Playable,Shut up!
Leon,Male,Playable,Enough! God damn it.
Leon,Male,Playable,This time… it has to be different.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,You go first.
Leon,Male,Playable,"No way. Like I told you, I'm gonna get you home safe. Here goes nothing."
Leon,Male,Playable,Ashley...? Ashley...?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I'm right here.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I thought you were gonna die.
Leon,Male,Playable,You did this?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Yeah. Yeah I did this. Can you stand?
Leon,Male,Playable,That a map?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Yeah, I found it. I think it says we can get out if we go...this way. Hey, we're a team, right?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Keep this up? I'll be out of a job.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"So, all of this? Removing the parasites... This was Luis?"
Leon,Male,Playable,I'm surprised this thing even booted up.
Leon,Male,Playable,Someone had a field day looting the Umbrella labs…
Leon,Male,Playable,Sorry.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Like I said, we're a team!"
Leon,Male,Playable,You're getting good at that.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Right?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,You sure you're OK?
Leon,Male,Playable,Never been better.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Good.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Look at this place! That woman who helped us... do you think she's all right?
Leon,Male,Playable,"Oh, I'm sure she's fine. She's not the type to roll over that easy."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Sounds like you know her well… Hey, wait! Leon!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Where are you going!? Don't leave me!
Merchant,,Non-Playable,"Nothing but the finest wares! Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. Heheheheh, thank you. There's some things money can't buy. Crossin' your T's, dottin' your I's. That's the way to be. We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend. Try that on for size. Anything else I can 'elp you with? Lightweight and easy to handle, this weapon has a lot of power."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Leon, look! Is that-?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Ada!
Leon,Male,Playable,He thinks he's going to lure me out. Stay here. I won't be long.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Okay.
Leon,Male,Playable,Ada!
Leon,Male,Playable,Saddler!
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,You foul renegade! You have forsaken the Holy Body… the great gift...to become one with us. You require ABSOLUTION!
Saddler,Male,Non-Playable,"Such blasphemous desecration! Such unforgivable heresy! Yet, is it not the sinner who is in most need of salvation?"
Leon,Male,Playable,I'm getting sick of your shit!
Leon,Male,Playable,"Finally a look that suits you, Saddler. A monster in and out. Still, I need to cut this date short. It's not me, it's you."
Ada,Female,Playable,Use this!
Leon,Male,Playable,I'll give you a holy body!
Leon,Male,Playable,Ada. What the hell are you doing?
Ada,Female,Playable,"Nothing personal, Leon. Luis and I had an arrangement. Don't worry, I'll take good care of it."
Ada,Female,Playable,Ride's here. You coming?
Leon,Male,Playable,I think we both know this is where we go our separate ways.
Ada,Female,Playable,I see.
Ada,Female,Playable,Better get a move on.
Leon,Male,Playable,Cute.
Ada,Female,Playable,"Until next time, Leon."
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Leon! Where's she going?
Leon,Male,Playable,Who knows.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I don't understand. Why would she just—?
Leon,Male,Playable,Better move. Island's gonna blow.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,It's gonna WHAT!?
Leon,Male,Playable,Yeah.
Leon,Male,Playable,"OK, let's get out of here!"
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Yeah! Now we can go home!
Leon,Male,Playable,We're not outta here yet.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Thanks.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,They're not attacking. What's going on?
Leon,Male,Playable,They're nothing now their master's gone. It's over for them.
Leon,Male,Playable,You like thrill rides?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I love them!
Leon,Male,Playable,You're gonna love this!
Leon,Male,Playable,Hold on!
Leon,Male,Playable,You all right?
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,I'm not sure! That was insane!
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"Mission accomplished, right?"
Leon,Male,Playable,Mission accomplished...when you're home safe.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,Thank you for saving me.
Leon,Male,Playable,Don't mention it.
Ashley,Female,Non-Playable,"You know, I could put in a word with my dad. Have you assigned to my detail, if you're interested?"
Leon,Male,Playable,"You don't need me. You proved you can handle yourself. Even if you could use a lesson in knife safety. Come on, let's go home."
Hunnigan,Female,Non-Playable,Condor One? Roost to Condor One! Do you read me? Come in! I said come in! Is this thing even on? Leon! Leon! Are you and Ashley all right? Where are you? Come on!
Ada,Female,Playable,Patch me through.
Ada,Female,Playable,I've obtained the Amber.
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Excellent.
Ada,Female,Playable,Just one question. What are you planning to do with this?
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,I do not pay you to ask questions. All you need to know is a new dawn is breaking. A hundred will give their lives so that just one may live. I am expediting that change.
Ada,Female,Playable,"So, we're talking millions of casualties."
Wesker,Male,Non-Playable,Billions.
Ada,Female,Playable,How ambitious.
Ada,Female,Playable,We're changing course. Now.
